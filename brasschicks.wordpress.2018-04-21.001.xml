		<title>Brass Chicks is Moving to Wordpress!</title>

Although it's had a great run at its old <a href="http://brasschicks.tumblr.com/">Tumblr home</a>, Brass Chicks has grown up and now seems better suited to the Wordpress format.  The new Brass Chicks will be less a collection of profiles of female brass musicians ("musician baseball cards"), and will have more interviews with musicians, reviews of and reports on concerts,  and articles about what it's like to be a woman in the brass world.

We hope you share our excitement for the future of this blog in its new incarnation!  You can look forward to some sweet new content headed your way in the next few months.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>All-Female Street Bands:  Brass Chicks Hit the Streets</title>

This past October, WBUR Boston published <a href="http://www.wbur.org/artery/2016/10/04/original-pinettes-honk-fest" target="_blank">a great story</a> about <a href="http://www.originalpinettes.com/">The Original Pinettes</a> in anticipation of the band's <a href="http://honkfest.org/">Honk!</a> performance. All-female brass bands are a growing phenomenon, bringing the awesomeness of women playing brass to festivals, parades, and the streets.  This blog has historically focused on classical and jazz performers, but I want to take this opportunity to branch out and highlight these incredible musicians!

<!--more-->
<h3>The Original Pinettes</h3>
The <a href="http://www.originalpinettes.com/">Original Pinettes</a> are New Orleans' only all-female second-line brass band.  Founded at an all-girls' school in 1991, they are now a multi-generational group of women from many walks of life.  They worked to unite their community when Katrina tore it apart. And, in 2013, they even won the of the Red Bull "Street Kings" brass band blowout competition, earning the title "Street Queens!"

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucR-tqyquG4]
<h3>Yes Ma'am! Brass Band</h3>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/yesmaambrassband/">Yes Ma'am! Brass Band</a> was formed in October, 2012 in Austin, Texas.  Since then, they have toured to festivals around the country performing a mixture of covers and original charts, bringing parties wherever they go.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=433sR_YFSSo?start=248]
<h3>Filthy FemCorps</h3>
Filthy FemCorps started in January, 2016, in Seattle, Washington by Emily Smith and Liz Currey.  They are, in their own words, "a hot bag full of fierce badass women who aren’t afraid to be weird, genuine, raw, sweaty, confident, honest, loving and real."

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkr5a3E_gAI?start=155]
<h3>Boycott Brass</h3>
<a href="http://boycottbrass.tumblr.com/">Boycott </a>, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, describes itself as "a no-boys-all-badass brass band playing 90s pop hits, balkan tunes, and other songs from the European and American street band traditions."  With only five members, they are smaller than the other groups featured here.  Nonetheless, they make a big sound:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gsZveoGyAc?rel=0]

It seems to me that there are disproportionately many all-female street brass bands compared to the numbers of female brass musicians in more formal, establishment-type orchestras and jazz groups.  Perhaps these groups serve as a seperatist space for women to make music free from patriarchal cocepts of how music-making is supposed to work. In street bands, women can be loud, they can be raucous, and they can be free from needing concert venues' approval.  On the other hand, buskers I see tend to be male, probably because of safety issues associated with staying out on the streets all day.  But perhaps those safety issues can lead women to band together, creating brass band to find safety in numbers.

What do you think?  Does street music have special value as a venue for female brass musicians?  If so, why?]]></content:encoded>

Keep up the great work! I looking forward to reading about more brass chicks!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm glad you blogged about this. Whenever I have a chance, I love wandering the city streets and coming across street musicians. They seem to me to embody the urban space and transform it into an environment that everyone within listening distance emotionally shares. I think it's cool how encountering an all-female band can open up my thoughts about social roles in ways that other ensembles might not. And now, all I want to do is to go somewhere urban and find one of these four terrific bands....]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Brass Chicks is a blog written for and by women who play brass instruments.  It aims to create a space to share our personal stories, appreciate what other musicians are doing, and to perpetuate discussion of what it means to be a woman in this male-dominated industry.  Brass Chicks is here to record our history, celebrate our present, and build our future.

<a href="https://www.brasschicks.com/2017/07/13/meet-the-bloggers/">Meet the bloggers</a>

We aim to celebrate and promote the work of female brass players through interviews, news, and guest posts from fellow members of the Brass Chicks community. Our interviews typically follow a theme. Past themes include members of military ensembles, musicians who push stylistical boundaries, pioneer musicians who changed the scene for female brass players, prominent educators, and notable ensembles. We also curate a weekly series entitled Five Things Friday. Read more about it here:

These young women's beautiful playing is evidence that the future of brass music is surely female!  Congratulations for Hanae and Cristina on your lovely performance.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[via <a href="http://www.norway.org/News_and_events/Embassy/All-Female-All-Norwegian-Brass-Ensemble-tenThing-to-Tour-US-This-Spring/#.WLynMcvFzxA.wordpress">Norway.org</a>:  The ten-piece ensemble fronted by trumpet virtuoso Tine Thing Helseth is set to embark on its first U.S. tour this spring!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/width_650-height_300-mode_fillareawithcrop-pos_default-color_white.jpg" alt="width_650-height_300-mode_fillareawithcrop-pos_default-color_white" width="650" height="300" />

tenThing, a Norwegian ten-woman brass ensemble has performed brass ensemble music to the highest standard since its founding in 2007. Helseth and three of her trumpet friends founded the group after watching a string orchestra concert, because they wanted to match that caliber of  ensemble performance on brass instruments. The group plays entirely original arrangements and sometimes also uses choreography.

Hear them play and check if they're coming to your town below the break!

There's nothing quite like the thrill of hearing the words "International Women's Brass Conference" on public radio!

This month, in honor of Women's History Month, central Ohio's Classical 101 radio station has been publishing <a href="http://radio.wosu.org/term/women-brass">an excellent series</a>. The station's "Women of Brass" has  featured the <a href="http://radio.wosu.org/post/women-brass-mary-elizabeth-bowden-founding-all-female-seraph-brass">Seraph Brass</a>, the <a href="http://radio.wosu.org/post/women-brass-how-stiletto-brass-tearing-down-invisible-curtain">Stiletto Brass</a>, and<a href="http://radio.wosu.org/post/women-brass-how-horn-quartet-genghis-barbie-conquering-world"> Genghis Barbie</a> so far, and has aired recordings by female brass musicians on Saturdays and Tuesdays all month. It's great to see a prominent radio station supporting women brass musicians so overtly; classical radio shies away from innovation and mold-breaking. Shout-out to WOSU for proving that needs not be the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This blog is run by Kate Amrine and Rebecca Epstein-Boley. A trumpet player and a horn player, we are based in New York City and Ann Arbor, MI, respectively.&nbsp;We are both extremely excited about brass playing, the incredible women in the industry, and the role we hope Brass Chicks can play in publicizing the best of those things! The blog will be seeing some changes and a more steady flow of new content in the next few months, so we thought we might introduce ourselves to get things started.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-477" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16487269_10200527985061818_7143954736204799985_o-e1499655773950.jpg?w=300" alt="Kate Amrine, Trumpet" width="300" height="200">Kate, whose multifaceted career includes Broadway, off-Broadway, commercial, big-band, and orchestral playing, also maintains an active teaching studio and recently gave a recital and led a warm-up at the 2017 International Women's Brass Conference. This fall, she will release her debut album featuring works for solo trumpet by female composers.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-495" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nmffinalconcertphoto-e1499655835796.jpg?w=300" alt="NMFFinalConcertPhoto" width="287" height="194">
Rebecca, meanwhile, is currently working on her Bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan. She enjoys playing with student and professional ensembles such as Chamber Music Michigan, the Huron River Ensemble, the Ann Arbor Camerata, and the Dearborn Symphony, as well as maintaining an active private studio. She looks forward to further pursuing her love of chamber music after graduation. When not playing the horn, Rebecca enjoys drawing comics about music history.

The world of women in brass is vibrant, powerful, and growing fast. We aim for Brass Chicks to be a rich centralized source of information about everything happening in the women’s brass community. We want to showcase various perspectives and share exciting news and narratives.

Stay tuned for cool things soon to come!]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Mini Interview:</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do!</div>
<div></div>
<div>

<b>Outside of music, I've done about a dozen triathlons including 2 full Ironman triathlons. I'm an amateur baker and I have a dog obsession. I'm married to an amazing jazz trombonist, John Fedchock, and we've got two doggies, Mister and Dudley. </b>

2. <span id="m_-5748588138082211208gmail-docs-internal-guid-540f9981-3064-1a8f-148a-1f7adc8369b6">Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?</span>

<b>Do what scares you most. Always. Even if you fail. If I hadn't followed this advice, I'd be working for Bank of America right now. If you go in with the mindset of "I know it won't be perfect," you allow yourself to try. I'm putting this concept to work this month by doing my first gig as a leader - something that I was scared  about for years. </b>

<p id="m_-5748588138082211208gmail-docs-internal-guid-540f9981-3066-fce6-21b6-4462b9d93abd" dir="ltr"><b>As a brass player, male or female, read the <a href="http://www.osborne-conant.org/ladies.htm">full story</a> of what Abbie Conant went through  with the Munich Philharmonic. It is heart wrenching and horrible but she not only survived it, she thrived. Her story showed me that the best revenge is success. </b></p>

There is a lot of invaluable information on there and I still refer to it when I'm teaching. </b></p>

<em>This is a re-post of Jennifer Wharton's post on her own blog, <a href="http://jenniferwharton.com/blog/">View from The 4th Chair</a>. Please check out our previous posts for more about Jen and her interview.</em>

The International Women’s Brass Conference took place this past June in South Jersey at Rowan University. On top of meeting a bunch of ladies who rock, I was lucky enough to be asked to perform with Athena Brass Band, DIVA Jazz Orchestra and in Jeannie Little’s recital/presentation.

<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyPyeuMzUAhVDeT4KHdzmCyYQFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.athenabrassband.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFEknSM_FmNkac0ap1LjDN9TlzgnQ&amp;sig2=-qwfCYk7E8twc_17zDcHPw">Athena</a> was filled with professionals in service bands, brass bands and symphonies around the country and directed by my longtime friend, Jessica Sneeringer. I met Jess in the Disneyland College Band in 1999. (Read my article about it <a href="http://trombone.org/articles/library/viewarticles.asp?ArtID=101">here</a>.) After 5 extremely well-run rehearsals and a soundcheck, we took the stage. The music selection, the soloists, the level of sensitivity in the band – everything blew me away. We made some great music that night. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mTq6dlmWq0&amp;feature=youtu.be">listen to the Athena Brass Band at the IWBC 2017 here.</a>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-103" src="http://jenniferwharton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture1-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="750" />

My second performance was filling in for Leslie Havens in the <a href="http://divajazz.com/">DIVA Jazz Orchestra</a>. DIVA is led by drummer Sherrie Maricle and has been around for decades and has been home to folks like Ingrid Jensen, Nadje Noordhuis, Jen Krupa, Sharel Cassity to name a few. It’s always really impressive how deep the “bench” is for DIVA – there are always new players that get some of their first big opportunities from Sherrie. I always feel like it’s an honor to be able to sub in the band and try my hardest to do a great job in Leslie’s absence. There are some tasty stuff for the bass bone to play in Scott Whitfield’s arrangement of <em>76 Trombones</em> and on <em>I’m Gonna Go Fishin’. </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z84U8Y6f_Ds&amp;feature=youtu.be">The whole concert is can be viewed here.</a> Enjoy!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104" src="http://jenniferwharton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Picture1-2.png" alt="" width="750" height="750" />

Finally, on Saturday, I joined Carol Jarvis (Sting, Seal, London Symphony), Natalie Mannix (University of North Texas, Delaware Symphony) and Donna Parkes (Louisville Symphony) for Jeannie Little’s (Montana State University and loads of orchestras) recital/presentation. We played Jeannie’s arrangement of <em>Getting Sentimental Over You </em>and then she spoke about Tommy Dorsey and his influence on French music, specifically Tomasi. I wish I could’ve taken everyone with me back to NYC!

I didn’t get to see as much of the conference as I would’ve liked. I didn’t get to talk to Abbie Conant (who I met doing a Chinese Funeral in San Francisco but that’s a different story). I didn’t get to hang a lot afterwards. But what I did hear and see and the people I did meet will stay with me for a long while. Ladies, YOU ROCK!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>I am so excited to present Nicole Abissi - our next featured guest Brass Chick blogger, who also performed at IWBC. We have played together in NYC and I was really interested to hear her responses to our interview questions. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with the Brass Chicks community!</em>

Nicole Abissi is a member of the renowned Stiletto Brass Quintet since 2013. She frequently plays with many of the country’s fine orchestras, as well as on Broadway. Nicole received her Bachelor of Music degree from The Juilliard School and Master of Music degree from Stony Brook University.

In 2007, Nicole began a fellowship with The New World Symphony in Miami, Florida. There, she had the opportunity to work with the premier conductors of our time, as well as receive lessons and coaching from many of the finest brass players in the world today. Nicole won her first professional position as the Second Trombonist of the Alabama Symphony in 2009. In September of 2012 she joined the Colorado Symphony as acting Principal trombonist for the 2012-2013 season. In addition to her performance experience, Nicole is a passionate teacher.

<h2>Mini Interview:</h2>
1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do!

<strong>I am a trombonist with a varied career. I was primarily an orchestral player until joining the Stiletto Brass Quintet in 2013. Now I play chamber music, Broadway, orchestra, brass ensemble, new music, and commercial music. I love to teach almost as much as perform and my blog has given me an outlet to share my ideas with a wider audience.
</strong>
2. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?

<strong>I wish I had let go of perfectionism in the practice room at a much younger age. Striving for perfection isn’t helpful because it does not exist. We need to not be complacent or accept mediocrity, but we also need to practice self-love and acceptance. Where I am right now as a musician isn’t where I always want to be. But in order to get where I want to be, I need to put in a lot of honest practice time and self-loathing is not going to help me achieve my goals.</strong>

3. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.

<strong>I think every musician should follow the <a href="https://bulletproofmusician.com/">Bulletproof Musician</a> blog. It has so many helpful posts about performing and practicing. I also always recommend Golf is Not a Game of Perfect to people. It focuses a lot on the mental aspect of performing and essentially the phenomenon of mind over matter. </strong>

4. Lasting thoughts / tips / ideas / comments?

<strong>There is a lot more to what we do than just practicing the notes on the page. Explore what you can do to improve your mental game and never underestimate the importance of being kind and respectful to your colleagues. I still work with people I met when I was 14 as an Intermediate camper at Interlochen Arts camp. One of those people is currently a member of the New York Philharmonic and came to my son’s first birthday party. Another is a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra and more play in the National Symphony and other orchestras around the world. Every person you meet should be treated with respect and consideration, because you will probably work with them for the rest of your career. </strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is a re-post of Nicole's post from her own blog, </em><a href="http://www.citytrombonelessons.com/">City Trombone Lessons.</a> <em>Please check out our previous posts for more about Nicole and her interview.</em>

At the start of this month, I had the privilege to be a part of the 25th International Women’s Brass Conference. In addition judging some of the competitions, I performed with the Monarch Brass Ensemble. Every time I play with these incredible musicians I feel inspired and re-energized. The support for one another is palpable on the stage as well as in the audience. The way that we feed off of this energy is in our musical risk taking.
<p class="">It is often the case that a performer expects the audience to be looking for things she or he does wrong. As if each audience member is actively ticking down marks for each missed note. After a lifetime of auditions to get into summer festivals, schools, competitions, and jobs, it’s not a surprising response. At IWBC, the overwhelming feeling in recitals is that people are there to hear what you do well. We want to know what we can like about yoour performance rather than trying to find things wrong with it, or trying to judge how we measure up to one another. I’m not sure why this is so strongly the case here and not as much elsewhere, but I do know that we should keep this in mind when each of us is an audience member in the future. Attend a performance to see what you can admire about the musicians. What can inspire or move you? Send thoughts of support and respect out into the world when someone is brave enough to put themselves out there. These acts will come back to you when you are the one on stage, and I promise you will be grateful for it.</p>
<p class="">For those of you who weren’t able to attend, here are some live videos of the evening performances.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am so excited to create the Brass Chicks community and have the opportunity to showcase incredible stories and musicians. In addition to guest posts and interviews, there will be a variety of other posts &#x2013; some themed and some not.</p><p>Announcing our new series called Five Things Friday!</p><p>This new series of posts will allow for many other guests to contribute and highlight their own individual perspectives. The list format is also a little different than our other posts so it may be easier to catch up with Brass Chicks related news on the go!</p><p>For this first Five Things Friday post &#x2013; I wanted to share 5 reasons that I am happy to be involved in the Brass Chicks community and why this project is so important.</p><p>1. Awareness</p><p>I am currently on tour with an orchestra in Japan and on our flight the other trumpet player and I realized one of our flight attendants just started learning trumpet in Japan. We invited her to our concert and she said she would try to attend. Here is a picture we took together:</p><p><img class="alignnone" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_6128.jpg" alt="IMG_6128" width="3264" height="2448">She told us that her teacher in Japan told her that due to her body structure and gender that lip slurs and other techniques would be very challenging for her. This was unbelievably shocking to hear for many reasons and we were quick to inform her that this wasn&#x2019;t accurate information. She was surprised to learn that there are so many female brass players who are doing incredible things and hopefully this gave her a different perspective moving forward. This blog is for her and anyone else who may be in a situation where exposure to these powerful perspectives from women in the brass community can be extremely transformative.</p><p>2. Network</p><p>Even though I live in NYC (the center of the universe &#x1F603;) I realize that there are many other perspectives and stories worth sharing from all parts of the world. We can learn so much from everyone and I hope that Brass Chicks can be helpful in facilitating this process. So far Brass Chicks has been viewed in over 10 countries which is unbelievably exciting!</p><p>3. Inspiration</p><p>When I was younger, I didn&#x2019;t realize how many inspiring women brass players were out in the world doing incredible things. I didn&#x2019;t realize how many different ways there were to make a living as a musician. I hope that Brass Chicks can provide some inspiration to younger musicians &#x2013; at a time when it can be most valuable.</p><p>4. News</p><p>There are a few other organizations that are great for brass related news &#x2013; and our monthly theme is after all, the International Women&#x2019;s Brass Conference, so we are very thankful for this organization and others. We hope that we can provide a space for updates and announcements in the women&#x2019;s brass community &#x2013; everything from upcoming CD releases to performances and more.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The incredible all-female brass quintet, Seraph Brass, has almost reached its crowdfunding goal on Indiegogo. The group aims to raise $25,000 in order to fund their first album, which they will release in early 2018. It will only take a few more donations to push them past the $25,000 mark -- <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/seraph-brass-debut-studio-album-music#/">could some generous Brass Chicks make the difference?</a>

<a href="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0364.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-640" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0364.jpg" alt="" width="1136" height="756" /></a>
From the fundraiser page:

"Seraph Brass began in 2014 and is in high demand, presenting over 50 domestic and international concerts in the 2016-17 season. We are a dynamic brass quintet drawing from a roster of America’s top brass players. Committed to engaging audiences with captivating programming, we present a diverse body of repertoire that includes original transcriptions, newly commissioned works, and well-known classics. Recently, we commissioned and premiered “Wolf” for solo soprano and brass quintet from Philadelphia-based composer, Joseph Hallman and have had several arrangements made by Utah Symphony trumpeter Jeff Luke and composer Thomas Oltarzewski. Through our mission to commission and premiere new works by American women composers, we hope to continue to encourage women of all ages to study and love brass music. We have performed a number of masterclasses at universities, high schools, and middle schools. Seraph Brass is on the Allied Concert Services roster, performing tours throughout the United States. Seraph is managed by Manhattan Music Ensemble."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We have enjoyed celebrating the International Women's Brass Conference through our interviews with Jennifer Wharton and Nicole Abissi and their individual blog posts. We are so excited to present our final interview of the month - featuring Joanna Hersey. </em><em>Thank you again for sharing  your thoughts with the Brass Chicks community!</em>

1. <strong>Tell us a little about yourself and what you do.</strong>

<!--more-->

Many ask how I began to play the tuba, and I always say it was totally meant to be, I started playing tuba during my eighth grade year in a small Vermont town in the mountains, twenty-seven miles from the Canadian border. East Haven, population two hundred and ninety-eight, had two schools, kindergarten through fifth grade in one small building, and sixth through eighth grades in one classroom next to the town clerk’s office. My eighth grade graduating class was the biggest the school had ever had…nine!

The afternoon came when we were given instrument rental forms to take home and discuss with our parents. I decided that I wanted to play the violin, however, since no high school anywhere nearby had an orchestra, my mother encouraged me to pick a band instrument. Not seeing anything on the list which struck my fancy, I returned to school the next morning having decided not to play anything. Seeing my lack of enthusiasm for the instrument list, the teacher offered me the chance to play a sousaphone which was not being used in a nearby school. This seemed like a great solution, because I did not know what a sousaphone was.

The rest, as they say, is history. He brought it for me, and it was white, plastic and bumpy. “Okay, blow into it,” he instructed. I gave a tentative puff in general the direction of the mouthpiece. Nothing happened. Mr. Hueling uttered the now immortal words, “You’re going to have to blow a lot harder than that if you want to play the tuba.” I took up a large breath and let go with all my might, a large blast rang through the building, students in class looked wildly over their shoulders in alarm, and I had begun to play the tuba.

From then on, I have spent my days in a room with the instrument, trying to figure out how to do it better, and help other people do it better, driving and flying it all over the world.

2. <strong>What do you love about being a female brass player?</strong>

One very special thing that I am so proud of is that I have become involved with the International Women’s Brass Conference, an organization which helps provide scholarships,  and presents conferences for men and women, featuring many female brass soloists and educators. The group is made up of both men and women, and the mission is to educate, develop, support and promote women brass musicians while inspiring continued excellence and opportunities in the broader musical world. So while we want to showcase women in performance, we also want to involve men as well as young male and female students in our educational outreach events, to try and break down separation by gender for all instruments.

As President, I am able to give back to an organization which has given me so much at a crucial time in my young career, having attended the very first IWBC conference in 1993 as a young military musician.  I see my role as a director of sets of people, committees and groups each working on smaller pieces of the puzzle, such as membership development, new composer commissions, educational outreach, etc. I can see the big picture and where things can overlap, and direct forward motion. We just completed the 25th anniversary 2017 conference at Rowan University in NJ, and our next one will be in May 2019 at Arizona State University, my alma mater!

3. <strong>Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

Most of us sit in sections as either the only female brass player, or one of a small minority. We sit in those sections for our whole lives, our whole careers. Even with wonderful male colleagues, many of us feel we can never miss a note or be imperfect without putting on the line the rep of every single woman in the field. So we sit under the pressure of that at every single gig we play. Every conductor comment, every glitch, under a microscope.

Perhaps because of this, young women go into the career in lower numbers. They’re not willing to put up with the teasing and feeling different (young people want to fit in!) and don’t see it as something for them. I recently taught a set of tuba masterclasses to 94 tuba players from the nation’s top performing high school programs, schools with super supportive booster groups, great leadership and budgetary support. Even in a group of this level, only 11 of those tubas were female. So still 88% male in our most supportive American programs in 2017. Last year I taught a studio of 27 college tuba and euphonium majors, only three of which were female.

One of our challenges is we see that in the past we were not okay with regard to race and gender equality, but we think it’s fixed now. People often ask me if I teach male and female students differently, and I don’t, but I do teach some students differently. I divide them in my mind into two categories (that don’t have to do with gender). There are the students who are very driven and ready to find challenge and are pro-active. These students need help with balance and staying focused on fewer tasks, keeping from becoming overwhelmed, etc. The other group of students, especially with tuba, are the students who love it, but are not used to being super-challenged there in the back of the band, and are approaching life waiting for things to happen to them. This group needs different teaching, they need to be reminded about being proactive instead of reactive, and goal-setting and advanced planning would be helpful. Both groups need support but in different ways. As the teacher I have walked their path already, gotten bruised and disappointed, had the way blocked, but kept going…and now I can help them along, just as my teachers did with me.

We also can work on featuring women and minority composers in our performances, and there are a lot of terrific resources out there for us. I have an upcoming series with Cimarron Music Press, called the <em>St. Cecilia Series</em>, featuring music I’ve arranged by historic women and minority composers for brass. Michael Parker and I just recorded an album with JAM - Joanna and Michael that featured several new works in this category for solo, duo and quartet. My albums <em>O quam mirabilis</em> (2010), <em>Prelude and Groove</em> (2012), and <em>Zigzags</em> (2015), are places to find repertoire. There is a great set of databases on the International Alliance for Women in Music website (<a href="http://iawm.org">http://iawm.org</a>) on where to find music in various genres, featuring a  link to a brass music database complied by Monique Buzzarté.  Following young composers on social media is a great way to become informed about new works. Finding music for any genre by women and minority composers takes an extra step of research but opens up so many connections with new colleagues and can inspire a who new set of composers to start working.

4. <strong>Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own or when teaching?</strong>

The music world is very different that when we, the middle-aged professor generation I’m in, were trained, and it is so important for us to recognize and embrace that. My degrees are all in performance for example, but I have to excel at various aspects of music education, music business, entrepreneurship, marketing, accounting, booking, management, grant writing, etc. I have had success because I figured out this mattered and got my act together and learned it, and I am flexible and adaptable as things change. A great way for people to stay informed is to listen to podcasts, I’ll mention a few of my favorites below. But stay flexible, and don’t be too tied to what you thought you’d be doing before you got to the place you are now.

One challenge we face as musicians, is our world is divided too much by race and gender. While this is a part of regular life, we can start to change that by becoming aware when we do it. Things such as how we treat people in positions of authority, as professors in a university setting, as colleagues in an orchestra or brass band, how we react when the person in authority is a women or a minority, how we hire new people, etc. We can develop young leaders when we teach with this in mind. Women and minorities are promoted in smaller numbers, in university settings and in performance, and people unconsciously have an image associated with what success in the field of music looks like. If you don’t match that image, you are at a disadvantage. Luckily though, this can change and if it matters to enough people, we can fix it.

5. <strong>Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?”</strong>

I wish I had done more clear advanced planning when I was younger.  Some type of 5 and 10 year out type of planning is very helpful. As we begin our careers things can seem overwhelming, and I have seen people take on projects that don’t match their goals, then get mired down and off track. The way I deal with that is I have a dry-erase board hanging above my desk. It’s divided into boxes, one for each of the next four years, then a future box. I color code the projects and spread them out, for example recording projects need to be started a year or two out. This helps me see what’s coming up and then I can decide to add something new, or put it in an upcoming year, and stay focused on what I enjoy. If I find myself feeling overwhelmed I can reorganize the chart without feeling like I am out of control. Now…color coding boards won’t be everyone’s thing, but it works for me, and that’s the key, find what works for you and stick to it. Goal setting time is one of the most beneficial aspects of your week.

One of the best pieces of advice I ever received came at a time when I was gathering courage to begin a new phase of my life.  I had decided to leave my position as Principal Tubist with the United States Coast Guard Band, and begin studying at New England Conservatory with Chester Schmitz, then Principal Tubist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Visiting my grandparents to break the news that I was leaving a steady job to study performance full-time, their next door neighbor stopped by.  Lt. Leonard Godfrey lived for forty years next door to my grandparents, and was navigator of <em>The Great Artiste</em>, a B-29 bomber which flew the Nagasaki bombing mission during World War II. He returned from that mission very much changed, having seen too much of the consequences of war. As I nervously explained my dreams to them, he looked across at me, a young woman who played the tuba, and said “Security is a myth.”  He, a gentle, elderly man seeing me through his vast vision of human experience, saw that I should go for it. I’ve never forgotten that, and look back at his support as one of the most important moments of my life. It reminds me that we have chances every day to look at young people and either encourage or discourage them with how we react to their vision and dreams.

Also…it really is true…long tones. Every day.

6. <strong>Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings etc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm excited to write Brass Chicks' second-ever Five Things Friday! Because I have struggled a lot over the years with performance anxiety, I have had to work to find functional solutions. In this post, I will share five of my favorites. I hope they will help other musicians as much as they have helped me.

<!--more-->
<h2>1. Breathe Deeply</h2>
The number one thing that helps me with nerves is controlled breathing. Slow, mindful breathing exercises. Not only does deep breathing release stress-inhibiting neurohormones, it also reminds me how my air should feel when I play.
<h2>2. Perform Before you Perform</h2>
The only real way to practice for a performance situation is by performing. I like to play for people as much as possible, in order to make myself more comfortable doing it. Even playing an excerpt or two for family (or a pet!) can help.
<h2>3. Wear Flats</h2>
Disclaimer: I see other badass women wearing heels and performing wonderfully all the time. Their work is amazing and hugely impressive.
Personally, though, I don't ever wear shoes with high heels. To me, they're just another sexist way to keep women uncomfortable. Even if I did wear them, though, I would never wear heels and then stand to perform! At a time when I already feel shaky and posture is crucial, unstable shoes are the last thing I need. My concert oxfords are my best friends.
<h2>4. Eat a Banana</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">I'm not sure if the "bananas combat performance anxiety" thing is true, but the placebo effect is real. You can't argue with results! I like to have a banana about 45 minutes to an hour before a big performance.

<span style="color:#999999;">[via <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=78575">http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=78575</a>]</span></p>

<h2>5. Have a Plan</h2>
My biggest anxiety symptom is that my mind wanders in performance and I become easily distracted. When I have a detailed plan for every note, bar, and phrase in a piece, I can focus on that instead of the kids talking in the audience or what I'll eat for dinner.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Since we are still gathering Five Things Friday posts from guests (please reach out to us if you want to be involved!!) I will be writing the post for today </em>:)

Here are my five tips for a productive practice session! And the best part? These are all things you can do <strong>away from your instrument</strong> :) I have done my fair share of traveling, touring, and various things where getting physical time on the instrument can be difficult. Maybe you are tired from a string of gigs or a summer festival but know you still have material you need to work on. Some of these things you can do instead of a practice session or can take place before and during a session. See what works for YOU! So here we go:

<!--more-->

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. Take care of your body!</strong></span> This means getting enough <strong>sleep</strong>, eating <strong>healthy</strong>, and having <strong>coffee</strong> or tea if that is what gets you going in the morning. But most importantly: <strong>stretching</strong> and <strong>exercise</strong>. There is a reason that many successful people start their day with <strong>yoga</strong>, other exercise, or <strong>meditation</strong>. Interested more in the power of a morning routine? Check out <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/07/19/morning-routines-and-strategies/">these tips</a> collected from hundreds of conversations with top performers by entrepreneur Tim Ferris!

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. Make a plan!</strong></span> Most successful performers have<strong> practice journals</strong> and specified <strong>goals</strong> to work towards - including concrete steps to get there. This can be super focused like "I want to work on playing loud second trumpet excerpts today" or or a little broader like "I want to continue to improve my lead trumpet playing" or "I want to win an orchestra job" but the most important thing is how you get there. Check out this great website on <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">how to set goals</a> that are SMART!

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3. Sing or play another instrument!</span></strong> This is a great one for when we are in long car rides or traveling or on a hike or going through a playing injury or any situation where you can't actually physically play your instrument but still want to get stuff done! We are all so lucky to have our voices with us at all times and we can always sing through pieces, scales, other exercises, or sing along with music. Playing another instrument like piano is great because it brings you closer to that child-like discovery and fascination you first had with music (but more on that later). Practicing on another instrument can even make your primary instrument skills stronger because it builds your greater musicality and will strengthen your ear.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. Listening and mental practicing!</strong></span> Can't get your hands on another instrument or sing? No worries! Turns out there is actual scientific research that says when we mental practice we are actually activating the same parts of our brain as when we physically practice. Crazy! Check more out <a href="https://bulletproofmusician.com/how-effective-is-mental-practice-really/">here </a>and <a href="https://bulletproofmusician.com/does-mental-practice-work/">here</a>. Mental practicing can be great when you are physically tired in the practice room but want to keep working - maybe you can even alternate running through a passage in your head with actually playing it. And listening? There is so much to say about the power of listening for musicians - everything from listening to our heroes and what we want to sound like to listening to pieces we don't know to learn them. One important thing about listening is that it can be great to expose yourself to music and styles you aren't familiar. You never know when you could get called for a gig or be in a situation where knowledge of Indian classical music or another 'not typically studied in standard music school' style could be helpful!

5. Last but not least: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspiration!</span></strong> What made you excited about your instrument in the first place? What are you looking forward to playing later this year or later in your career? What group would you LOVE to play with? What group do you want to start or solo piece do you want to learn? Hopefully if you are organized with your goals and your planning these are all things you are thinking about daily but keep them in check in the practice room as well! It can be so easy to get bogged down by scales and very specific technical practice that we can lose sight of the child-like wonder we had when we first picked up the instrument. We get to make music and spend lots of time every day trying to do that even better. How exciting!

Feel free to comment here or on our Facebook page about this post and anything else that might be relevant. We would love to hear from you!]]></content:encoded>

</em>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/lessie.jpg" alt="lessie" width="960" height="960" />

</em><strong>A Grand Prairie native, Lessie Vonner’s love of music began at a young age when she picked up the trumpet at eleven. Lessie’s passion encouraged her to pursue a music education at the renowned Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, TX. While in high school, Lessie started her first quintet that had the honor of being the opening act for jazz violinist Diane Monroe at the Black Academy of Arts and Letters.</strong>

<strong>With aspirations to pursue a career in the music industry primarily as a professional trumpeter, composer, and educator, Lessie chose to continue her education at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York City. Since arriving to New York, she has had the privilege of studying under many outstanding and experienced musicians, some of which including Cecil Bridgewater, Charles Tolliver, Jimmy Owens, Tanya Darby, Ingrid Jensen, Reggie Workman, and Bobby Sanabria. Along with her studies, she has also gained some teaching experience as a private instructor for the Jazz Big Band's trumpet section at Frank Sinatra High School for the Arts in Queens during her first years of college. She currently teaches at Upbeat NYC, a local non-profit that uses the pursuit of musical excellence and ensemble performance to bring about positive change in the lives of South Bronx children.</strong>

<strong>Presently she performs in many venues throughout New York City and has performed at other music scenes across the world. She also performs in numerous groups around the city, and Lessie has worked with many artists such as Beyoncé, the BET Black Girls Rock All Star Band, Jessica Care Moore, the Tokyo Jazz Orchestra, Kathy Sledge, Space Captain, and many more.</strong>

<em>Thanks to Lessie for sharing your thoughts with the Brass Chicks Community! Check out her post: </em>

Congrats, you’ve just graduated from music school! That in itself can be a difficult task, and now you have to prepare for an even harder one - getting into the music industry. Now, if you had the opportunity to study in a city such as NYC, hopefully you’ve already started making the steps towards integrating yourself into whatever scene you want and already have an idea of what to expect on your journey. But if (for whatever reason) you haven’t, there are several things that might be good to know going in. Here’s a quick overview of some things I have come to learn over the years on my own journey in the jazz and contemporary music scenes.

1. <strong>You Aren’t Owed Anything Just Because You Went To Music School</strong>

I know, I know - this can be a difficult thing to hear. You’ve spent all this time and money - maybe even took out a second mortgage - to get your degree. Now after all that, you realize that this sheet of paper doesn’t guarantee you gigs? For some, it can be a tough pill to swallow. It doesn't make it any less true. Don't get me wrong, graduating from college will always be a good look - it shows that you got some level of commitment for your craft. But at the end of the  day, people don’t really care about what degree you have or where you went to school. What they do care about are things such as if you’re a good player, how well you can execute the music, how well you work with others, etc. Which brings me to my next point:

2. <strong>You Have to Be Able To Do Your Job</strong>

It seems to go without saying, but you’d be surprised how rare it is to find musicians who do their jobs in their entirety. If you get hired, it’s safe to say your can play the music. But will you have put in the time and effort to know the music inside and out? Will you show up to the hit on time and maybe even (god forbid) early? Can you act professional and get along with anybody while you're on the gig? Can you do the very thing the band leader/conductor/MD hired you to do? What’s the use in being able to play a thousand licks over hundreds of chord progressions if you can’t play the five notes exactly where they want to hear them? In this industry, there are literally thousands of people who can do what you do, and being able to do your job in the fullest will make you stick out. I’ve learned that anybody can get the call for a gig - not everybody will get the callback.

<strong>3. There Are Politics All Throughout the Scene</strong>

Politics, racism, sexism, bias - you name it, I can guarantee it happens. Sometimes, it doesn't matter how great of a musician you are or how professional you are - there will be spaces that will not welcome you no matter what you do. As a Black female trumpet player, this is one of the hardest things that I’ve had to come to terms with. My saving grace has been finding my community. The people who are always in my corner and will always look out for me. Finding your community can be one of the most important things you can do when getting into a scene. Once you do so, you can begin to create your own spaces and scenes. Never underestimate how far a good support system can take you, and NEVER forget to give support to others!

<strong>4. Don’t Be Afraid to Branch Out Musically</strong>

One of the things I wish people would let go of is the notion that you should only stay in one genre of music. I mean, if you only want to do one thing, then godspeed, you do that thing to the best of your ability. However, if you like several different genres, why not branch out? Some of the best musicians that everybody loves have had their hands in several different music pots (insert Miles Davis, Chaka Khan, and Queen Latifah here). I was the type of girl who studied and played jazz music all day and night, and would then come home and turn up to some good ole R&amp;B, Funk, and Hip-Hop. For the longest, I allowed myself to be influenced to think that if played anything other than jazz, I wouldn’t be respecting the music or I’d be “selling out.” However, once I opened myself up to the idea that it was ok to play music outside of jazz, I couldn't believe the opportunities that opened up to me. Not only was I able to work more, but I’ve been able to come across so many beautiful people who I can add to my network. I find that it has also served to broaden my creativity. The world of music is so broad - why limit yourself?

<strong>5. Stay In Your Lane</strong>

It can be easy to compare yourself to others, especially in the NYC music scene. You have such a melting pot of musicians of all ages, backgrounds, and levels, and it all can be a little overwhelming at times. You may notice that so and so may be gigging more than you or certain things seem to come easier to others than it does to you. Though it may be hard, you can’t focus on what other people are doing/saying. You owe it to yourself to know what your goals are, and to actively work towards them. Trust the process - if you know that you are truly doing everything in your power to reach your goals, know that you will eventually reach them, no matter the time it takes. Understand that there will be ups and downs in this line of work and that we’re all going through it, no matter how it seems. Stay in your lane, and keep your eyes on the prize!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are so excited to present our first guest of August: <a href="http://www.genghisbarbie.com/">Genghis Barbie</a>! Genghis Barbie has changed the game for chamber music ensembles, inspiring countless younger musicians with their character, musicality, and unrepentant sense of fun. It was an honor to feature them in an interview. We heard from each Barbie and cannot wait to share their amazing responses with you later this week! </em>

<img class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" src="http://www.genghisbarbie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/group3-e1418793203160.jpg" alt="group3" width="1200" height="1056" />

<strong>GENGHIS BARBIE, </strong>the leading post post-feminist feminist all-female horn experience, is the most innovative and energizing chamber ensemble of its generation and beyond. With a combined 24 years of conservatory training, Genghis Barbie delivers to you a visceral and unadulterated musical adventure. Performing arrangements of pop music from the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 00’s and today, contemporary commissions, and classical works, they are the most versatile and expansive group on NYC’s classical/pop/rock/jazz/indie/alternative/punk/electro-acoustic scene. Genghis Barbie was incepted in a unique moment of ingenuity when Freedom Barbie, Cosmic Barbie, Velvet Barbie, and Attila the Horn converged and vowed to create distinctive, interactive and personal performances. In addition to their busy New York City performing schedule, the ladies of Genghis Barbie have performed as Contributing Artists at the 2011 International Horn Society Symposium in San Francisco, played Schumann's Konzertstück with the Southern Methodist University Wind Ensemble, and appeared on America's Got Talent. In May 2012, Genghis Barbie made their Carnegie Hall debut in the premiere of a new concerto for four horns, commissioned by the New York Youth Symphony. As educators, they have toured numerous universities presenting workshops, masterclasses, and lectures on musical entrepreneurship. They have released four studio albums: the self-titled debut album, the holiday album “Genghis Barbie: Home for the Holidays,” “Genghis Baby: Songs for Noa,” and the newly released “Amp it Up!” Genghis Barbie aspires to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show within one calendar year.

<strong>1. What is it like being in “the leading post post-feminist feminist all-female horn experience?” Tell us about your experiences! How did you all get started?</strong>

Each Barbie had a unique musical journey that led us all to New York City. We all crossed paths whether at school, summer festivals, or freelancing. Eventually, the four original members converged at Freedom Barbie's bachelorette party. I thought it was cool that four young women all essentially competing in the same music business were all good friends. I made a mental note, and months later, this idea popped into my head: I was in a rehearsal with Attila the Horn (Rachel), and I blurted out, "We need to have a horn quartet and play pop music!" It wasn't long before we were setting up shows, making CD's, and, most importantly, organizing photo shoots! (for a while we joked that we had done more photo shoots than performances...) From there it was a natural progression to where we are today. We've always striven to play music we love at the highest level, and have a great time playing and traveling together. -Velvet Barbie

<strong>2. What have you done as a group and individually to get to where you are today? Any secrets for success?</strong>

Obviously as individuals we have all put in countless hours of practice on the horn.  We all have a natural drive to make music as individuals and a group, so we all continue to keep ourselves at a level on the horn where we can fully express ourselves musically.  Each of our methods for doing that are different, but what it comes down to is finding your own daily routine. One of my former teachers, Chuck Kavalovsky, had his "Daily Dues," which he passed down to me- things that I do everyday on the horn to keep me feeling good.  And I will say: always spend a little extra time on the things that you aren't as good at!

The other part of our success in our individual careers and as a group is that we are all true to ourselves and what we want in our lives.  I think we all truly enjoy our careers as musicians, the type of work we do, and how it fits into our lives.  The same goes for us as a group.  We have always focused on things we wanted to do and then executed them together.  We made this group because we wanted an outlet to play music with friends and to be able to unleash some creativity and share our joy of performing together.  All of the recordings, traveling, and business partnerships have all been towards the goal of making the best music we can together and sharing the love of music we have with others.  -Attila the Horn

<strong>3. What do you love about being a female brass player?</strong>

Recently I spoke at a "Women in Music" symposium. A young student asked, "What are the advantages of being a female brass player?" First, I laughed, and said "None!" One thing I do appreciate about being a female brass player is, I suppose, that it is more accepted for us to be sensitive, emotional players (on the flip side, we are often unfairly judged for our perceived "aggressive" playing or behavior...). What I really love about being a "female brass player," though, is really just being myself. Part of what makes Genghis Barbie such a fun group to be a part of is the fact that we are four very individualistic people who enjoy coming together into one unit. We each bring our own personality, strengths (and weaknesses!), artistic preferences and expressions, etc. Playing in any ensemble should be the same way, no matter how big or small. In a perfect world, one's gender wouldn't play a role in how we are viewed and heard, but in the struggle to that point, we should continue to recognize the imbalances and biases that currently exist in our field. -Velvet Barbie

<strong>4. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

Being a female brass (especially horn) player is not uncommon anymore.  I was raised in an environment in which I was told that with hard work and perseverance, women can accomplish as much as men, if not more. For long as I can remember, I truly believed this, and still do.

I don't know if I have a specific role or responsibility as a female brass player. I'd like to believe that I have a specific role and responsibility as a citizen of the world and as a professional in my workplace. I believe that relentless hard work, persistence, kindness, focus, integrity, open-mindedness, authenticity, patience, passion, and most of all positivity, are the drivers in my quest to feel fulfilled and to contribute my best to my group and my world. Man, woman, or anyone beyond the binary, I believe it is our responsibility to emphasize our energy towards strengthening these qualities in order to continue making strides towards genuine and rightful workplace equality.

It's a shame that in 2017 we even have to discuss gender equality but I acknowledge our society and the business we work in still has a long journey ahead. In the New York Philharmonic, Orin O'Brein was the first woman to join the orchestra in 1966. Fast forward 51 years, and now the women outnumber the men. The numbers of women in the brass world are growing each year. The future is where it's at. -Freedom Barbie

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?</strong>

Music matters! The greatest horn players were and are artists in addition to expert instrumentalists. Being a great technician, especially on an instrument like horn that has such a rich, distinctive tone, can only take you so far, whether in an audition or any performance. I spent way too much time as a student focusing on accuracy (i.e. not missing notes) and using that as the only criteria when evaluating the success of my performances. Now I see things in term of the bigger picture: Am I deeply committed to musical intent in what I'm playing? Making my best sound possible? Trying to create a shared experience with my audience versus protecting my own ego by playing it safe? And since these have become my primary considerations, my accuracy and fluency on the horn have actually increased. It's easier to be in a flow, and for natural, easy execution to occur when you get your focus off not making mistakes and play with a desire to be an expressive and effective communicator. And in the end, beautiful, compelling music counts for a lot more in the minds of audiences and audition panels than a few missed notes!

DON'T WAIT to take chances or put yourself "out there" until you think you are ready! I am so grateful to my teachers and classmates who encouraged me to just go for it, be it an audition or a solo competition, and not worry about whether I was in the perfect place to suceed 100%. I started taking professional auditions while still in undergrad because I knew I wanted a career as an orchestral musician. I definitely wasn't qualified for those first few jobs I auditioned for, but I wouldn't trade the experience of them for anything! When it really counted, I had lots of previous experiences and test runs under my belt by virtue of taking those, not to mention familiarity with the way auditions are run. And in my case, it took me 20+ professional auditions (with summer festival, grad school, concerto competition auditions NOT included) to "crack the code" and land my job. If I had waited until I thought any of those attempts was a sure thing, I would probably still never have taken any audition ;-) The one caveat is, be sure the repertoire you're preparing is within your skill level to play solidly and correctly, and prepare like you mean it! Don't do it by half-measures even if you think the job is a moonshot. Some day, it won't be if you start taking tangible steps toward your goal now! -Cosmic Barbie

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we've taken Five Things Friday to highlight some amazing women's brass ensembles in history. These groups are as different as they come and range from famous to barely-remembered. Nonetheless, every ensemble on the list proves how women have been playing brass for centuries!

<!--more-->
<h2>1. The Hormel Girls</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-890" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ppb_mnshort_elisa_korenne_hormel_girls_image-resize-710x399.png" alt="The Hormel Girls" width="710" height="399" />

After World War II, Jay Hormel, the owner of the Hormel Company, promised to give a jobs to those who had served in the armed services during the war. In fulfilling that promise, Hormel founded a touring women's drum and bugle corps to promote his company, employing an original fifty-six women. The group, which became known as the "Spamettes," was America's first-ever professional all-female drum and bugle corps. They competed in the twenty-ninth American Legion National Drum
and Bugle Corps Championship Competition, becoming the first all-female group to compete in that competition. As the New York Times saw it, "for the first time in American Legion history, an all-woman drum and bugle corps composed of veterans of World War II [was] making ready to challenge male supremity."

The group performed for seven years, eventually also producing a radio show, singing, and dancing in addition to their instrumental acts.

<h2>2. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="unnamed (3)" width="800" height="507" />

In 1937, Lawrence Jones was looking for ways to raise money for the vocational school he ran a for poor black children and teenagers in Piney Woods, Mississippi. He started an all-girl swing band to tour the East coast raising money.

In 1941, the group began touring across the country, went professional, and severed ties with their school in Piney Woods. They shot to fame and, in 1944, they were named "America's No. 1 All-Girl Orchestra" by Downbeat magazine. The first racially-integrated all-female band in the United States, The International Sweethearts of Rhythm had members of black, white, Chinese, Mexican, and Indian descent. The two white members passed as black to skirt Jim Crow laws in the south.

In 1945, they performed in Paris and Germany on a six-month European USO tour, and then the group disbanded in 1949 after 12 years of roaring success.
<h2>3. Aledo Ladies' Cornet Band</h2>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-987" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/phot3896-e1503091143201.jpg" alt="phot3896-e1503091117328.jpg" width="376" height="200" />

In 1882, a man named "Prof." E.D. Wood moved to the town of Aledo, Illinois with the goal of starting a music store. Once the store was up and running in May of that year, he also started a "Conservatory of Music" ($4 per week with board and use of instruments), where he trained an all-female brass ensemble. The group trained for a year, performed for the town of Aledo on the Fourth of July, and then toured to Burlington, Fort Madison, and Keokuk, Iowa. Wood composed an original piece called "The Ladies Cornet Band March" for the ensemble. The band performed regularly around Aledo and surrounding areas of Illinois for about two more years, and then broke up when Wood unexpectedly died in 1885.
<h2>4. 1900s Damen Blasorchester und Damen Trompeterkorps</h2>
[gallery ids="1024,1026,1025,1023" type="rectangular"]

In Germany and Austria-Hungary in the early 20th Century, the widespread popularity of military bands gave rise to dozens of female brass or wind ensembles. Usually called <em>Damen Blasorchester</em> ("ladies' wind bands") or <em>Damen Trompeterkorps</em> ("ladies' trumpet corps"), these groups proliferated in the dozens, perhaps always with a male bandleader and often with both male and female musicians despite their names. The bands performed professionally in public venues such as restaurants, spa towns, dance halls, and Biergartens. As evidenced by the large surviving number of photo post cards with their images, these ensembles were likely valued for their visual appeal and apparent incongruity as much as for their musical appeal.
<h2>5. Trinity Girls' Brass Band</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/trinity.jpg" alt="Trinity" width="877" height="507" />
<span style="color:#999999;">[The following is adapted and largely quoted from the <a href="http://www.trinitygirlsbrassband.org.uk/">Trinity Girls' Brass Band Website</a>:]</span> Trinity Girls Brass Band, based in Garswood, England, is a traditional British brass band comprised entirely of female members. The group was established in 1959 thanks to a local woman, Margaret Stokes, at a time when there were hardly any female brass players around, if any at all. Margaret, a local midwife, was at the time in charge of the local Girls Guildry and after hearing the ‘musical efforts’ of the local Boys’ Brigade, decided that ‘girls could make a better attempt’. She took the revolutionary step and set up an all-girls brass band. Although Margaret had no previous conducting experience, she was more willing to give it a go.

Two years later, the band broke away from the Girls Guildry to become an independent organisation under the name of the Girls Guildry Band. It later became The Trinity Girls Silver Band, named after the Holy Trinity Church to which it has originally belonged. People in the local village were very proud of the Girls band and their reputation as the only all girl band in the country soon spread.

The band began competing in 1970 and continues performing and competing to this day!
<h2>Bonus: Fordham Nuns' Orchestra</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-879" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nuns-orchestra-e1503084650752.png" alt="Nuns Orchestra" width="877" height="545" />

This was a full orchestra and not a brass group, but this ensemble was too cool to leave out. In the summer of 1954, nuns who worked as schoolteachers convened at Fordham University's School of Education for a professional development. As a part of the workshops there, each nun was instructed in the skills it would take to start and run a student instrumental ensembles. As those skills included knowing how to play a variety of instruments, each nun learned to play the trumpet and clarinet before choosing her favorite instrument to play in the All-Nun Orchestra concert at the end of the program. Along with spreading music education, this one-time concert and its feature in LIFE magazine provided some incredible photos for posterity!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Super excited to share another great productive and helpful Friday post - this one from trombonist Melissa Hagstedt.</em>

<strong><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1127" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_11061.jpg" alt="IMG_1106.JPG" width="391" height="391" /></strong>

Melissa is a graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts High School,  and is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Music Performance at New York University. While at UNCSA she studied with John Ilika. At UNCSA she performed frequently with the Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Band, Trombone Choir and Wind Ensemble. Prior to her time at UNCSA, she was a member of the 2013 National Association for Music Education’s All Nation Concert Band. Currently she is studying with Dr. Per Brevig and plays in various ensembles throughout the NYC area such as the NYU Symphony Orchestra, NYU Brass Choir, and the NYU Brass Trio. She has had experience as a pit orchestra musician in the productions <em>Lucia di Lammermoor,</em> <em>Don Giovanni, Ballad of a Baby Doe </em>and <em>Pirates of Penzance</em> with both the Blue Hill Troupe, Utopia Opera Company and Vocal Productions NYC.

<em>Thanks, Melissa, for sharing your practice strategies with the Brass Chicks community!</em>

Here are my five favorite practice strategies. Each of these practice strategies have been personal breakthroughs which I feel have helped me make great strides in becoming a better player. I hope that you will try some of these out to see if they work for you!

<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wake Up Early.  </strong>I have found that waking up early to practice, especially during the school year, can be extremely helpful.  First of all, if you are practicing in a music building at school, you will likely be one of the only people practicing.  Because of this, it will be quiet which allows you to concentrate on what you are doing rather than the annoying vocalist’s warm up next door.  Secondly, it will feel great knowing that it’s only 9:00am (or whatever time you choose) and you already have an hour or two of practicing under your belt.<span style="color:#ffffff;">gjekwag;ewa </span></li>
	<li><strong>Stretch.</strong> Trombone players don’t start their days playing <em>Bolero </em>just like trumpet players don’t start their days playing <em>Petrouchka</em>.  As brass players, we need to start our days playing long tones, lip slurs and buzzing.  Shouldn’t our bodies also get a chance to prepare themselves for the coming practice session?  Before starting any practice session, I like to stretch because it helps to relieve tension and start the practice session with a sense of ease in movement.  Stretching is not only helpful for the singular practice session in which it is done, it will also help to prevent future injuries.</li>
</ul>
Here is a <a href="https://internationalmusician.org/stretches-that-every-musician-should-do-before-playing/">website</a> with great examples for stretches which can be done at both the beginning and completion of a practice session.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathe</strong>.  This one is a little bit more specific.  There are many different breathing exercises that you can experiment with on your own.  I encourage you to create your own or find some that work for you.</li>
</ul>
This particular exercise really helped me to break a barrier in my breathing stamina.  All you need for this exercise is a piece of paper, a wall and the ability to breathe.  So go to the wall with the piece of  paper.   Press the paper against the wall.   Take a deep breath and release the air pointedly at the center of the piece of paper.   While you are exhaling, you should not be touching the paper.  In this exercise you are trying to hold up the piece of paper with your air alone. It may be difficult to do at first but if you keep at it, it can be a great help.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Record Yourself.</strong> When we play our instruments our brains have many things to focus on.  We are reading the music, trying to be technically accurate in our sound production all the while trying to be musical.  It is nearly impossible to be entirely focused on the entire product of these efforts.  Our ears can lie to us, which is why recording devices (much like our frenemies the tuner and metronome) are so important; they do not lie.  You can learn a great deal of information from listening to a recording of yourself.  Am I in tune?  Was my tempo consistent?  Did I create a quality musical phrase?  Was I musical?  Listening to recordings of yourself can be irritating when you first start out, but the more you do it the less you’ll hate it because you’ll become your own teacher.  You will hear what needs to be improved and do it on your own.  Eventually, you will actually like what you listen back to (sometimes)!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Phones.</strong>  It is easy to become distracted by the endless stream of notifications which constantly pop up on our phones.  These notifications can pull our attention from the task at hand.  When practicing, we need to be focused on what we need to accomplish in that particular session.  If our attention is pulled every few minutes by what is going on in the world outside of the practice room, a very minimal amount of work will be accomplished.  However, phones can also be great tools, if used properly. Metronomes, tuners, recording devices and music players can be found on our phones.  These tools can enhance the productivity of a practice session, but only if we do not allow ourselves to be disturbed by the notifications.  In the practice room it is important to know how to both utilize and separate ourselves from technology because it can be both a help and a hinderance to our practice time.</li>
</ul>
Happy Practicing!

As Summer 2017 draws to an end, we look back on a prolific four months of album releases featuring female brass musicians. With music including classical, jazz, and mariachi, this summer's albums have something to offer for everyone.

NB: If you or a friend released an album this summer and we missed it, let us know in the comments!<!--more-->
<h3>May 5: Audrey Ochoa Trio - <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Audrey-Ochoa-Trio-Afterthought/release/10323586">Afterthought</a></h3>
<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1186 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/r-10323586-1495321810-4017-jpeg.jpg?w=300" alt="R-10323586-1495321810-4017.jpeg" width="300" height="270" />From <a href="http://audreyochoa.com/about-audrey/">audreyochoa.com</a>:
Audrey Ochoa is one of Edmonton [Canada]’s most prolific trombone players, playing Jazz, Rock, Pop, Latin, Punk, Ska and whatever other genre will have her.

Audrey released her debut album in 2014, “Trombone and Other Delights” which spent several consecutive months on the !Earshot! Jazz Charts, eventually earning the #5 spot on the annual top 10 for 2014. Most recently, Audrey has completed her second album with her trio “<strong>Afterthought.</strong>” The new album features her own compositions performed by herself and two of Edmonton’s finest, Mike Lent and Sandro Dominelli. Lending his mixing talents to the trio will Battery Poacher (Dallas Budd), who will be adding the sounds of psychadelia, hip hop and house to this otherwise bare bones trio of Bass, Drums and Trombone.
<h3>May 19: Bria Skonberg - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twist-Bria-Skonberg/dp/B06XZ9RNRL?tag=smarturl-20">With A Twist</a></h3>
<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1189 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/81woa19enkl-_sl1500_.jpg?w=300" alt="81wOA19ENkL._SL1500_" width="300" height="300" />From <a href="http://www.briaskonberg.com/product-page/with-a-twist-autographed-cd-may-19th-usa">briaskonberg.com</a>:
"The euphoric buzz of New York, over cocktails on the edge of evening, alive with possibilities…anything goes. Vocalist, trumpeter and songwriter Bria Skonberg re-imagines it all on her new OKeh/Masterworks album, With a Twist. Coming off a recent Juno Award (Canada’s version of The Grammys) for her first OKeh collection, Bria, Skonberg spins her cool and confident vocal style---and her sleek and timeless jazz chops---into a program that playfully nods to tradition while always looking ahead.

Of the mood she was going after on With a Twist Skonberg says: 'The inspiration was love and adventure, and the many twists and turns and tunnels you can get into. It’s a little about my time in New York, a little bit of cocktail culture. The musical inspiration was a modern-day Esquivel, Perez Prado, maybe some Spike Jones. It’s just important to me to put some love and positivity out into the world right now.'"

"Hailed by The Wall Street Journal as one of the “most versatile and imposing musicians of her generation,” Bria Skonberg was recognized last summer as one of “25 for the Future” by DownBeat magazine and Vanity Fair cited her
as a Millennial “Shaking Up the Jazz World.” Skonberg is a self-described “small town girl” from Chilliwack, British Columbia, who hightailed it to Vancouver straight out of high school and earned a degree in Jazz Trumpet Performance. To date, she has performed at some 100 festivals worldwide. She is the co-founder of the New York Hot Jazz Camp and New York Hot Jazz Festival. Further accolades include her recent 2017 Juno win for Vocal Jazz Album of The Year for Bria, Best Vocal and Best Trumpet awards from Hot House Jazz Magazine (2014-15), Outstanding Jazz Artist at the New York Bistro Awards (2014), DownBeat Rising Star (2013-15), and a nominee for Jazz Journalists' Association Up and Coming Artist (2013)."

<h3>May 26: Mariachi Flor de Toloache - <a href="http://www.chulorecords.com/shop/flor-de-toloache-las-caras-lindas-digital">Las Caras Lindas</a></h3>
<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1192 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fdt_album_cover.jpg?w=300" alt="FDT_Album_Cover" width="300" height="271" />From <a href="http://www.mariachinyc.com/">mariachinyc.com</a>:
"Latin Grammy Nominees Mariachi Flor de Toloache make New York City history as its’ First and Only All­-Women Mariachi Group. Founded in 2008, Mariachi Flor de Toloache is lead by singers Mireya I. Ramos (founder) &amp; Shae Fiol (original member). Reminiscent of the early days of mariachi the group started as a trio, Harp, Violin and Vihuela. Today, Mariachi Flor De Toloache performs as a full Mariachi ensemble. The members hail from diverse cultural backgrounds such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Australia, Colombia, Germany, Italy and the United States. This defines their unique flavor and sound. The result of this cultural bouquet is an edgy, versatile and fresh take on traditional Mexican music. They coalesce as would a band of sisters, with a grace and vibrant beauty that casts a spell over their audiences not unlike the legendary Toloache flower still being used in Mexico as a love potion. While working to preserve centuries old traditions of Mariachi, their melange of the traditional and the modern pushes the boundaries of the genre and brings Mariachi music to new audiences."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are very happy here at Brass Chicks to be celebrating 6 weeks of  Five Things Fridays! We have had six different Five Things Friday posts so far that have been helpful, eye-opening, and inspiring. Thank you so much to our guest Brass Chick bloggers and our readers! We cannot wait to see what comes next :)

Submissions are coming in fast but we do still have openings for mid October thru the rest of the year. Please  do not hesitate to reach out to us at brasschicksblog@gmail.com or on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brasschicks/">Facebook page</a> if you would like to write a post for the future!

New to Brass Chicks or still unsure exactly what a Five Things Friday post entails?

Five Things Friday is a weekly series where the writer states 5 things that are important, interesting, or helpful to her. These can be 5 things learned, 5 things you love, 5 examples of xyz, or anything else that gets you excited! We love this format because it allows ANYONE to write a post regardless of experience level or background. Examples include: 5 favorite trumpet players, 5 recordings that changed your life, 5 things you learned in your time at school– the possibilities are endless.

In terms of format - we don't have a length limit set for each of the Five Things but please check out previous posts for an idea. If you are interested in writing a post, reach out to us with a Friday in mind, and then your post will be due to us the Monday beforehand. We will also post your photo, a bio under 250 words, and any links you may want to share.
We hope to hear from you soon and thanks for being a part of the Brass Chicks community!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Resources for Audition Season - Kate Amrine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are approaching the beginning of the semester and the beginning of the freelancing season! I hope you have all had a great summer and are now gearing up for something exciting this year. Maybe that might include an audition! Here are five resources that might be helpful to you this year and beyond throughout your audition path - whether it is a school placement audition or your first orchestral audition.</em>

1. <strong><a href="https://bulletproofmusician.com/">Bulletproof Musician</a> - </strong>I know this website has been mentioned before on Brass Chicks but Noa Kageyama does a great job at outlining many helpful tips related to performance anxiety, music, and mindset. This <a href="https://bulletproofmusician.com/use-these-7-key-preparation-tips-to-be-more-successful-at-your-next-audition/">article </a>includes tips for future auditions related to your preparation beforehand.

2. <a href="http://www.robknopper.com/auditionhacker"><strong>Audition Hacker</strong> </a>- This is a great website that addresses many aspects of audition preparation - from practicing tips to concerns about what happens during the audition. Check out the articles <a href="http://www.robknopper.com/blog/2017/8/17/5-steps-to-preparing-your-audition">here</a>.

3. <strong><a href="http://crushingclassical.libsyn.com/denise-tryon-her-secret-to-audition-success">Crushing Classical Podcast</a></strong> featuring <a href="http://denisetryon.com/">Denise Tryon</a> - Denise Tryon (former Fourth Horn of the Philadelphia Orchestra) is a master of the low horn and orchestra auditions. This interview describes her audition path and includes several helpful tips! Denise Tryon also runs an <a href="http://auditionmode.com/">audition workshop</a> to help students prepare with mock auditions, masterclasses, lectures and more. Check that out also!

4.<strong> <a href="https://angelabeeching.com/">Angela Beeching's</a> blog. </strong>Angela's blog is so incredibly helpful on a wide range of topics including performing, speaking, marketing, and networking. Since the earlier points in this post are more about the physical aspects of playing and how/what to prepare, I knew a post on <a href="https://angelabeeching.com/five-productivity-hacks/">how to boost productivity</a> would be super helpful to make sure we all stay on track in our preparation.

5. Find out what it's like on the other side of the table -- the panel! If you know someone in the organization, you might be able to find out an extra tip or two about what they could be looking for. Set up a mock audition with friends and alternate who is on the panel taking notes. You will learn SO much from being on the other side of it. Here's a very interesting interview featuring <a href="http://maxinekwokadams.com/">Maxine Kwok-Adams</a> - 1st violinist (I know, I know...this is Brass Chicks) in the London Symphony Orchestra. This <a href="https://www.thestrad.com/how-to-be-successful-in-an-orchestral-audition/2893.article">interview </a>with Maxine describes what it is like from her point of view on the panel - everything from what they may be looking for, common mistakes, and other tips.

Happy practicing and audition preparation :) Got any other good audition tips? Reach out to us on our Facebook page and let us know. We would love to hear from you!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>In honor of school starting up again, throughout September we will be featuring interviews with inspiring teachers of the women's brass community. </em><em>We are so excited to present <a href="http://denisetryon.com/">Denise Tryon</a> as our first interview of the month. Thanks again Denise for sharing your thoughts with the Brass Chicks community!</em>

<img class="mfp-img" src="http://denisetryon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/137.jpg" alt="" />

A native of Roseville, MN, Denise Tryon joined The Philadelphia Orchestra in 2009 as fourth horn. Previously the fourth horn of the Detroit Symphony (2003-2009), she has also held positions with the Baltimore (2000-2003), Columbus (1998-2000), and New World (1995-1998) Symphonies and has participated in the Colorado Music Festival and the Pacific Music Festival. An accomplished solo performer, Tryon has performed recitals in Sweden, Norway, Poland, Japan, and the United States.
<blockquote>“Denise Tryon’s command of the lower register provides the strongest foundation of sound for a horn section, and yet, her sound is supple and flexible.”
—Yannick Nezet-Sequin, music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra</blockquote>
<!--more-->
In 1989 Tryon graduated from the famed Interlochen Arts Academy and in 1993 received her Bachelor of Music degree from the New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) in Boston. She received the Presidential Scholarship while in the Artist Diploma Program at NEC with the Taiyo Wind Quintet, which won the Coleman Chamber Competition and worked with great composers such as John Harbison, Luciano Berio, György Ligeti, and Elliott Carter.

An active and accomplished educator, Tryon is sought after for her masterclasses. She has taught extensively in the United States, Scandinavia, Europe and Asia. Beth Graham of the Warsaw Philharmonic and founder of the Warsaw Horn Workshops raves, “In just a few seconds of listening to a student she can diagnose deep-seated problems and give immediate fixes, often with a healthy dose of humor as well. The transformations she can accomplish in just a short time are truly remarkable.”

Tryon released her debut solo album, SO•LOW in 2015. As a part of this album, she commissioned 4 new pieces for low horn and piano. In a review by Gramophone Magazine “Tryon plays these works with sonorous fluidity and dexterity ending with a bit of captivating acrobatics.”

In 2009, Tryon founded Audition Mode, a yearly horn seminar, with Karl Pituch. In 2010 she was an International Horn Society (IHS) Northeast Workshop Featured Artist. She was a contributing artist at the IHS Symposium in San Francisco in 2011, as well as one of the Solo Artists at the Nordic Hornfest in Norway in 2012. She was on the horn faculty at BIBA (Blekinge International Brass Academy) in Sweden in 2013, as well as one of the Solo Artists at the Warsaw Horn Workshops that same year. In 2014, Tryon was a Featured Artist at the IHS MidNorth Horn Workshop, and in 2015, she was a Featured Artist at the IHS Symposium in LA. Since 2007 she has served on the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.
<h2>Interview</h2>
1. How long have you been teaching? What do you love about teaching at Peabody? Any favorite teaching moments?

<strong>I have been teaching at Peabody for 10 years. I’ve had a private studio since I was 23. A few years ago I also taught at Temple University and Towson University. What I love about teaching, regardless if it’s an institution or privately, is the students. Watching those lightbulb moments is really rewarding. There are so many great moments in teaching. Here’s just one: I was working with someone going through an embouchure change. The high range is always the last thing to come back after a change. The first time this person obtained a high C, we both got up and did a little dance around the studio! I’m just happy to watch them develop and witness their success in life.</strong>
2. Tell us about your path from leaving a traditional orchestral career with the Philadelphia Orchestra to becoming the low horn specialist that you are today. Through your teaching videos, audition workshop, and your online course, your branding and social media presence is very inspiring and helpful to many. How have you cultivated your low horn brand over the years and we have to ask, why the octopus? Any secrets of success for teachers and students?

<strong>Well, I was certainly a low horn specialist before I left the Philadelphia Orchestra. As soon as I won my first job in the Columbus Symphony, I specialized in the low register of the instrument. As I moved my way up the orchestral ladder (Columbus, Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia) I became more and more interested in making an impact on the low horn world. I wanted to commission pieces for people to be able to work on and enjoy playing in the low register, since there weren’t many pieces already written. Around the same time, many people were playing for me, some for audition help, some for help just in the low register generally. I realised there was (is) a huge need for information about the low register on the horn. This is when I decided to start making teaching videos. In the beginning they were just about orchestral excerpts, but I have now started a 1 Min Q&amp;A series where people can ask me anything about the horn and I’ll make a short video. I can’t get as specific as I would like in those videos, but at least I’m getting some information out there! I want to show people you can be a great musician and a low horn specialist! :) As for “secrets of success”, I would say, focused, fundamental work is key. Work to ensure you are a well rounded player (you’ll be more employable) and be demanding, yet caring of yourself. There are 4 elements I look at when I am teaching someone (including myself): physical set-up, technique, music making and mental attitude. Don’t leave any one of those behind. You will only be as good as your weakest link! Now, for the octopus. I love them! I just happen to read an article about them roughly 6 years ago, and it has taken off! I wanted my logo to be one (and one of his arms turns into a horn), I have a little one attached to my horn, and people give me them as presents (not real ones :) ) all the time. Octupuses are so incredibly interesting, unlike anything else on this planet.</strong>

&nbsp;

3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?

<strong>I want to be a role model for young women to show them you can be a strong, slightly weird, passionate woman and have a great career. I’ve always marched to the beat of my own drum and at times I was admonished for it. If you let it, it can knock you down. But the true win is getting back up and going after what you want. The biggest aspect for me in my career is being sure young women see someone to model, and that means in our brass conferences, our interviews and podcasts, our accolades, we need to have women represented! There are many times I look at what is being publicly presented and there is NO balance. I truly don’t understand when that happens. There is still work to be done, sadly. When a conference happens and an extremely small percentage of the artists are women, we are showing half of the population they don’t have a significant role in our field. That’s unacceptable. We need to push for more inclusion.</strong>

&nbsp;

4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?

<strong>Today is a great time to be a classical musician. There are so many more doors open for us. You don’t have to follow the traditional road and become an orchestral musician. There are also a lot of really great players out there, so you need to be improving your playing always! Find something you are passionate about around your instrument/classical music/teaching/etc, and focus on that aspect. Be open to change. You think you know what you want when you’re in school, but life takes weird and interesting curves. Stay open to what that will bring.</strong>

5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?

<strong>Are there things I wish I’d known sooner? Yes. But I fully believe people and information are brought into our lives when we are ready to receive them. So I don’t look back and say, “I wish I’d known then what I know now”. There is so much more information available now, it can be overwhelming and at times confusing. Trust your teachers and yourself. Speak your mind. When you are younger, it’s easy to fall into the thought process that the fight (I am not a fan of that word) for equality is done. This simply isn’t true. You will run up against antiquated thoughts some of the time. Don’t accept it and try to deal with it in a positive way.</strong>

&nbsp;

6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.

		<title>Five Things To Keep in Mind as a Music Student</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are very excited to feature Bri Ihasz - a french horn student with some great things for all of us to keep in mind about music.</em>

<img class="  wp-image-1484 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20045494_10155417921103150_2484971594046072085_o.jpg?w=683" alt="20045494_10155417921103150_2484971594046072085_o" width="271" height="407" />

Bri Ihasz is currently a junior studying Horn Performance and the University of Michigan. The daughter of two musicians, Ihasz grew up surrounded by music in a small town south of Buffalo, NY. She absolutely loves the Michigan School of Music, but she’s also involved in other activities, such as being a part of the marketing team for a local independent record label and being a sister of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. She hopes to one day move to LA and either find work playing in lab orchestras or working for record labels.<strong>
</strong>

Thanks, Bri, for sharing your thoughts with the Brass Chicks community!

<em>“Wow, I’ve heard it’s a really hard instrument to play. And you’re at Michigan. You must be SO good.”</em>

This is the response I get every single time someone tells me I’m a horn performance major. And ok, I get it. I had to be at least halfway decent to get into this school. Horn is absolutely terrible to learn. I sounded like a dying elephant until approximately three years ago. Like, yeah I’m good, but I got good VERY recently. Point being, conversations like this can make it feel like there’s twice the pressure. Not only do you put pressure on yourself to do well, but you feel the pressure of strangers’ expectations. The weight of this concept literally crushed me into mental ruin last year, and so something I’ve been focusing on recently is the following phrase:

<strong>
1. </strong><b>“It’s not a big deal.”</b>
<div>

Sounds pretty freaking dumb. Okay, yes, definitely. But there’s nothing wrong with simplicity. And I guess that’s what I’m getting at with that mantra. For example, think of a general challenge a brass player would face.

<b>2. Relax in Technical Passages. </b>If you encounter a difficult passage with double tonguing, don’t worry. RELAX. It’s so hard to train our bodies to not react with increasing heart rate and shaky hands just because there’s an increasing amount of black ink condensed on a page. As one of my old horn teachers used to tell me, “Just read the black off the white.” Simple in principle. In fact, I always got so annoyed when he used to say it. But almost six years later, I finally understand. It’s so much better to breathe deeply and calmly and play an excerpt or an etude or a solo smoothly, rather than frantically spazzing your way through it.

<b>3. Relax in high passages also!</b> Playing high is the plight of all brass players. Again, all of my teachers have told me this, but it’s taken me almost 11 years of playing to realize that they were right all along. Nerves are directly connected to tension, which decreases air amount and increases the amount that muscles in the face have to work to produce a note. I’ve found recently that the less I care about how many ledger lines are under a note, the more likely I am to miss it. Because truly, it’s really not a big deal.

4. <b>Get Some  Perspective. </b>And perhaps most importantly, music isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Now before everyone gets mad at me, hear me out. As a child of two musicians, music has always been the be-all-end-all. I felt I was under so much pressure to be perfect at my instrument, which in my mind meant locking myself in a practice room all day every day. I envisioned going to a music conservatory my entire life, and somehow I ended up going to a Big 10 school.

5. <b>Get a life. </b>Gradually I’ve realized that being a professional musician does not mean sacrificing your happiness for your art; rather, they can be synonymous. I still love music with all my heart. But I also love my non-musician friends, my sorority, and spending time away from the music school. And when there’s a space of time where I don’t practice, I just have to bring myself back to the core of it. It’s really not a big deal. And in my experience, brushing off the pressure has really helped me find motivation inside myself to enrich myself in my art, without having to force myself to become that stereotypical isolated musician.

This summer, we were the featured artists at the International Women’s Brass Conference and at the Lieksa Brass Week in Finland. We recorded our debut studio album in Nurmes, Finland, and it will be released on Summit Records in January 2018. We commissioned two new works by women composers, Rene Orth and Catherine McMichael, and we also recorded original arrangements for the group by trumpeter Jeff Luke. We raised funds through Indiegogo, and we are so incredibly grateful to our fans for their support for this project.</span>

I set short and long term goals for my solo career path and the path for Seraph. Then, I make “to do” lists to make my goals happen. A lot of administrative work is involved, requiring constant networking and organizational skills. When I first formed Seraph in 2014, performing at the Lieksa Brass Week was a dream goal for maybe 5-7 years forward, and we were asked to perform there this past summer! Having a clear vision and acting on it makes opportunities happen.

I have the relentlessness to fine-tune my craft and work on small details. I see myself sometimes as a craftswoman-every morning I warm up and do lip bends and Clarke exercises, getting the gravel out of the sound and finding the resonance. I love the process of improving and finding ways to push the boundaries of my technique. The really fun part is performing and sharing music with audiences. I hope that I can be an inspiration to young, aspiring brass players.<u></u><u></u></span></div>

How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician? Do you have any advice for young female musicians?</span></strong>

I was very lucky in my youth to have a very strong female role model, my teacher Kari Lee. In my early years in the school band, I always tied for first chair with two other girls, so I didn’t start by thinking it was strange to be a female brass player. I think women are breaking gender stereotypes in many areas, and we are part of that movement.

I made Seraph an all women group to highlight women brass performers, and to be role models for musicians of any age. On our tours last season, it brought tears to my eyes to see handfuls of young girls jumping up and down after our shows because they were so excited to see professional women performing. I hope we can give them confidence and inspiration to keep making music. <u></u><u></u></span></div>

<span id="m_-9097605563789895632yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1504753166478_572914">My advice is the same to female musicians as it is to males: it is a quote from a plaque my parents had hanging in our kitchen growing up: “Everything cometh to he who waiteth, so long as he who waiteth, worketh like hell while he waiteth.”</span>

As I mentioned above, goal setting is really important. This is something I have in common with Joanna Ross Hersey, which she discusses in her interview. We both make not only short term goals, but long term goals. These can be practicing goals and career path goals. Even making a daily plan is helpful: What is my list today? What do I need to cover in my sessions? Articulation? Range? Make a list of upcoming music you have to learn for the semester/year, and make sure you are covering what you need. I often make these lists, and I make notes of the parts that I am the worst at and focus on those first.

Be inspired. Be curious. Practicing is a lot of work, but anything you want to master requires work. Listen to all types of music. Go to live performances. Seek out lessons with many people. Live out of your comfort zone.

<div id="m_-9097605563789895632yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1504753166478_572928"><span id="m_-9097605563789895632yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1504753166478_572929">In my youth, I was so worried about paying rent and bills. I let this worry consume me sometimes, and would fret that I had to work summer non-music jobs while my friends got to go to festivals. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself that it’s ok: through working these jobs I became very grateful to be a musician. I feel grateful being able to earn my living now as a performer, and through the jobs I developed administrative skills and a thick skin to be able to run and lead my own organizations. I want to make it clear to those musicians who have to work and study at the same time that you can earn a living playing music, you just have to work that much harder to achieve your goals. In a way, this will force you to be even more efficient in your practice sessions.<u></u><u></u></span></div>

I took my big risk in my late 20’s by deciding to start a solo career from scratch after meeting my mentor, Jens Lindemann. It’s what I had always wanted but never pursued because I was told I could not make a living from it-that getting an orchestral position was the only way. I love playing in orchestra, but now I see that performing in a variety of setting fulfills me-concertos, recitals, chamber music, opera, orchestra. I could not have gotten where I am today without a clear vision for my career and goal setting. <u></u><u></u></span></div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft" src="https://allisyar.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kristy-mcarthur-morrell.png" width="260" height="390"><em>Kristy Morrell is a faculty member at USC's Thornton School of Music as instructor of horn and chamber music and the chair of the department of Winds, Brass and Percussion, and at the Colburn School of Music. She has been a member of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra since 1997, and performs frequently with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Opera, Pasadena Symphony, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, Pacific Symphony and New West Symphony. She is also a respected recording artist, performing on numerous motion pictures, television soundtracks and records. Kristy has a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from USC, where she also received her Master of Music, and a Bachelor of Music and Performer’s Certificate from the Eastman School of Music. (Bio adapted from <a href="https://music.usc.edu/kristy-morrell/">music.usc.edu</a>)</em>

We are honored to share Dr. Morrell's thoughtful interview responses!
<!--more--><strong>How long have you been teaching? What do you love about teaching horn? Any favorite teaching moments?</strong>

I have been teaching for about 25 years and I love it more each day. There are so many wonderful moments almost every day that I spend with my students. I absolutely love it when I get an email or text from a student saying how much they appreciate my support and guidance. To me there is simply nothing better that helping a person pursue their dreams.

<strong>From private teaching to administrative work, orchestral playing to studio recording, it seems like you do it all. How do you balance your responsibilities?</strong>

Ha! Frankly, I could do better with this particular challenge. I live by my schedule and spend time planning weeks in advance. I have to make sure I have learned the music for upcomming performances and prepared materials for meetings well in advance. I get up early and go for a run in the mornings before I do my fundamentals routine which helps me to stay calm and focused.  I also have a family and try to make sure I have enough time to enjoy them. It is not easy, but being organized and making priorities helps a lot.

<strong>Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

I think all people have a responsibility to be kind and have empathy for our fellow human beings. In my capacity as a department chair at USC, that sometimes means I have to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves. I try to offer support and encouragement to everyone in a way that is most helpful (not just women). When I was getting started in the Los Angeles recording scene, others did that for me (mostly men, there weren’t many women around at that time). I would like to emphasize that men are not the enemy; ignorance and a lack of kindness are. As women we cannot make progress by disenfranchaising ourselves from our male colleagues, teachers and mentors. We will miss out on the opportunity to collaborate and to share our own gifts.

<strong>Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?</strong>

I think the current climate is actually very exciting for musicians. With appropriate training and an entreprenurial approach, careers in music can be more diverse and individual than ever before.  There are so many chamber groups thriving now. That simply was not the case 25 years ago when I was getting started. I try to emphasize the importance of doing what you love, strengthening networking skills, financial responsibility, and planning with my students.

<strong>Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

I would like to invite everyone to enjoy the journey from college into the professional world. Remember that it is ok to make mistakes and to ask for help if you need it. Your colleagues and teachers <span style="text-decoration:underline;">want</span> you to succeed and to be happy. We want the future to be better, more creative and full of music. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">You</span> are the future  and we want to enjoy your greatness. (I hope that makes sense to someone besides me…)

<strong>Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc. </strong>

I love reading biographies and am regularly inspired by how resilient people can be. I also love to listen to Doctor Radio on XM and other helath-related podcasts. I think that ours is a physical art and we have to care for our bodies like athletes do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are so excited to continue our September theme of celebrating inspiring teachers with our interview featuring trombonist and educator, <a href="http://www.nataliemannix.com/home.html">Natalie Mannix. </a></em>

<img class=" alignleft" style="max-width:100%;" src="http://music.unt.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Natalie_Mannix2.jpg" />

Natalie Mannix, principal trombonist of the Delaware Symphony, is an avid soloist, chamber musician, orchestral performer and educator. In fall of 2016 she began her current position as Assistant Professor of Trombone at the University of North Texas after teaching 8 years at Towson University in Baltimore. Previously, she was a member of the United States Navy Band in Washington, DC for over 9 years where she performed with the brass quintet, concert and ceremonial band.

She has appeared as guest artist and clinician at colleges and conferences throughout North America, including the 2016 and 2013 International Trombone Festival, the International Women’s Brass Conference, the Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic and the American Trombone Workshop. In addition to frequent performances with the Baltimore Symphony, Natalie has performed with the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington Opera and Kennedy Center Orchestras, the Washington Trombone Ensemble, the Monarch Brass, Stiletto Brass and several regional orchestras and brass ensembles. A new music advocate, she has commissioned several works for trombone and continues to perform and promote music by emerging composers. <!--more-->

Her recent recordings include a solo album, Breaking Ground: A Celebration of Women Composers and two chamber music CDs: the grammy-nominated Interchange: Concertos by Rodrigo and Assad with the Delaware Symphony and the LA Guitar Quartet; and Shadowcatcher: Music for Winds, Brass and Percussion.

As Euphonium soloist, Dr. Mannix won first place in the Leonard Falcone International Solo Competition and toured Europe as soloist with the Blue Lake International Band. She was also solo Euphonium for the Imperial Brass Band in New Jersey and a finalist in the International Tuba Euphonium Conference solo competition.

An avid brass pedagogue, Natalie has taught trombone at Shepherd and Georgetown Universities and has served on the faculty of Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp in Michigan. She has adjudicated international and area solo and ensemble competitions and serves on the Board of Advisors and as chair of the Competition Committee for the International Trombone Association. She is also an active member of the International Women’s Brass Conference.

Natalie received her degrees from the University of Michigan, The Juilliard School and her Doctor of Musical Arts degree from Catholic University. She is a performing artist for Edwards Instrument Company.
<h2>Interview</h2>
1. How long have you been teaching? What do you love about teaching trombone? Any favorite teaching moments?

I started teaching 5th and 4th graders private lessons when I was in 8th grade, and I have been teaching ever since. I started teaching adjunct at the college level while I was in the Navy Band about 15 years ago. What I love about teaching trombone changes with each age of the student. The younger kids improve so fast. It is really fun to see them surprise themselves by doing something they didn’t know they could do! The college students are really interesting people to talk to and get to know as people. Each of them has a different story and interests and challenges. Teaching private lessons can be like forensic science at times. The teacher has to do some sleuthing to find out what is wrong and try different techniques to help the student fix the problem. When something works, it is a great moment for both teacher and student! I love seeing the students perform. Their excitement when it all comes together and the energy on stage is contagious.

2. You wear and have worn many hats as a musician from your job in the Navy Band, to Delaware Symphony, and as a soloist with your recent CD - all while continuing to teach college students at Towson and now Univ. of North Texas. Any secrets of success to share for fellow teachers and students on maintaining a satisfying and diverse career as a performer and a teacher?

If you love what you do, it is always satisfying. I fell into most of this by just being open to opportunities. One job led to another. I didn’t start out wanting a military band job, but I took a chance and everything else followed that. There are many ways to piece together a comfortable living playing music, so seek out opportunities, create your own if none exist and keep working at improving. When I first graduated from Juilliard, I had a private studio of trumpet, horn and trombone students, worked part time as a data clerk for Frito-Lay, started my doctorate degree at Rutgers, took auditions and said yes to every freelance gig that came my way. It sounds like a lot, but only one of those things felt like work, because I was doing what I loved and was able to make a living while growing my resume and gaining experience.
3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?

I do, but that role has changed over the years. When I was younger, I felt that I needed to work harder and be better than men in order to prove myself as a woman. It was isolating and exhausting. Now that I’ve reached a point where I’m not as focused on advancing my own career, I enjoy being a positive example and role model for the younger generation, not as a female brass player, but as a brass player. In a perfect world, we would see equal numbers of women and men brass players and composers. We would not hear stories of sexism and sexual misconduct. Until that world is here, it is so important for women to have the International Women’s Brass Conference and to program music of women composers. Most of my motivation in performing at conferences and universities is to move in this direction. I continue to be approached by young women, especially those in other countries, who want to talk to professional women brass players because they don’t have any role models where they live. It can make a big difference in their world.

4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?

The market is so saturated with great players. It is so competitive. I encourage all of my students to be as well-rounded as possible. Take every opportunity to learn both jazz and classical styles and have a secondary area in a related field like education, performing health, or music business. Most trombonists will have to piece together a career in many ways: gigging in many styles, teaching, marketing and managing to name a few. When I graduated, I had to look beyond winning a job in a major symphony orchestra. Playing with the Navy Band led to a GI Bill that paid for my doctorate degree and great professional playing experience that I used for my college teaching resume. College teaching led to great opportunities to program my own recitals, travel to conferences, play in great ensembles and teach some incredible young trombonists. The path to success can look very different for each person.

5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?

I wish I would have had more confidence as a younger player. I was limited by my own insecurity. I should have believed in myself and not let others tell me what I could or could not do. I also dressed down in order to fit in with my male counterparts. It took me a long time to be comfortable with my abilities and uniqueness and recognize that I could be competitive with just about anyone if I allowed myself to be. I would encourage younger female musicians to feel good about themselves. Support each other. Don’t let anyone make you feel less valuable. Seek out opportunities with other women, like the International Women’s Brass Conference. I have never felt more love and support than I have there.

6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.

I’ve done a lot of mental work for performing. I love My Lessons with Kumi by Michael Colgrass and Effortless Mastery by Kenny Werner. Sound in Motion by McGill was a really important book in my teaching and interpreting music. Alexander Technique has really helped me in proper body use and relaxation while playing. I’m sure there are so many recordings! I would be too afraid to leave any out by only mentioning a few, but I will say that my first classical music heroes were the Canadian Brass. When I saw them in concert as a kid, I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This week's Five Things Friday is from trumpeter Amanda Ross, on her experiences with her contemporary chamber ensemble, Girlnoise. Thanks to Amanda for sharing her thoughts with us!</em>

[caption id="attachment_1542" align="aligncenter" width="502"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-1542" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_3490.jpg" alt="Girlnoise" width="502" height="377" /> Amanda Performs with her chamber ensemble, Girlnoise[/caption]

Girlnoise is an mixed chamber ensemble specializing in contemporary music and improvisation. Founded in 2015 in Ann Arbor, MI Girlnoise has collaborated with several local composers and musicians and has performed at UMMA, Canterbury House, and University of Michigan’s School of Music. In January 2017 Girlnoise held its first collective gathering, Meditation on Water, to help raise awareness for the Flint Water Crisis. As well as playing trumpet and arranging for Girlnoise, Amanda Ross is a doctoral student in trumpet at the University of Michigan.<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400;"><strong>1. Collaborate with everyone.</strong></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Work with artists both in and out of your area of performance, artistic discipline (dance, visual art, language), and experience level.  Interacting with people of varying backgrounds opens up options for projects and repertoire and engages more members of the community.  As a brass player I did not work extensively with woodwinds and strings on the chamber music level until the formation of Girlnoise, which is an open ensemble with a core group of flute, saxophone, trumpet, and cello.  In learning repertoire written for our group and improvising together (see number 2 and 4) we were posed with the challenge to negotiate how all of these colors and timbres would fit into a cohesive unit. It opened up our ears to a completely different realm of sonic possibilities.  We also made quite a few friends along the way; the more people you work with the larger your community becomes. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"><strong>2. Commission new repertoire, choose works from unfamiliar and new artists.</strong></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> As much as it is important to be open about collaboration in performance it is also important to be open about the performance and creation of repertoire.  Talk to local artists and composers, your friends, and within the ensemble to find/create a body of works that reflects the identity of the group.  Arrange pieces if not available for your instrumentation.  Finding work that already exists can be a challenge, especially if it isn’t a standard ensemble.  Don’t be discouraged!  Looking at line ups from new music festivals and concerts are great research starting points.  Some music festivals with up and coming artists include Strange Beautiful Music, Bang on a Can, and Nief-Norf.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"><strong>3. Play for everyone. </strong></span><span style="font-weight:400;">If you are in school and work regularly with faculty members in coachings reach out to teachers in other disciplines.  This could mean that they play a different instrument, play no instrument at all, or work within a completely different area of study all together.  Branching out gives the ensemble a chance to practice performing, connect with the community, and further establish and solidify the identity of the group.  You can learn from anyone and everyone!</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"><strong>4. Improvise regularly.</strong></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Improvising as an ensemble is one of the core foundations of Girlnoise, and one of our recent performances had a large portion being completely improvised.  </span><span style="font-weight:400;">While the methodology of improvisation can vary, its benefits are consistent" or something along those lines</span><span style="font-weight:400;">  Improvising improves communication on both at a verbal and nonverbal level, enables exploration of your group’s individual “sonic fingerprint” and helps individual musicians hone their technique and aural skills within the group environment.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"><strong>5. Perform often and for everyone.</strong></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Embrace any and all opportunities to perform.  School recitals are a great performance outlet however local businesses, schools, churches, co-ops, retirement homes, street corners, a friend’s attic/basement, and open fields are all examples of nontraditional performance spaces.  Working both inside and outside of the traditional recital format can expand the number of people you reach.  Outreach concerts, open improvisation and meditation gatherings, benefit concerts, sound painting workshops, and pop up performances are just a few examples of possible concert formats.  Your imagination and inspiration are the limit!  Record every performance with both audio and video if possible any media collected can be used as promotional material and/or material for group evaluation.</span>

Music is about connecting with others, sharing our experiences, and opening our ears, hearts and minds to others and the world around us. Embracing these connections not only enhances the music-making experience, but (and arguably more importantly) it helps us form a communities of artists and allies. These communities, both large and small, help open lines of communication and create opportunities for us to meet new artists. Personally, if I did not have the community of musicians that I have here at Michigan, I don’t know where I would be. They have given me and Girlnoise the fortitude and courage to “do our own thing”; because of this freedom to be who we are we have created sounds, spaces, and friends that we never would have had otherwise. This article is dedicated to them, thank you all for your unyielding support.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are so excited to continue last month's theme of interviews with inspiring women-led ensembles and feature the London-based trumpet quartet <a href="http://bellatromba.com/">Bella Tromba</a>.</em>

<img class="  wp-image-1571 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/june-05-2016_bella_tromba_portraits_094.jpg" alt="Portrait shoot. East Dulwich. Sunday 5 June 2016." width="401" height="268" />

<h2>Interview</h2>

<hr />

<strong>1. It is so inspiring that Bella Tromba has been an active trumpet quartet performing a wide range of music for over 10 years. With your own diverse backgrounds and a variety of children’s performance and engagements, the group seems like such a fun group to be a part of. Tell us about your experiences! How did the group get started?</strong>

<strong>Vickie:</strong> Bella Tromba was founded in 2004 when four female trumpet students were waiting to do their orchestral auditions at the Royal Academy of Music. There was a lightbulb moment and we thought let’s get together and play through some quartets. Under the guidance of the late James Watson we continued to play together and before we knew it we were an established ensemble!

<strong>Jo: </strong>If I am honest I didn’t have a clue that anything would come of it but the more we played together the more we enjoyed it and we had a lot of encouragement from our professors. Jim (Watson) even pulled the Academy Principal into our rehearsal room so he could listen to us and he took it so seriously that my mind started ticking over and I thought maybe we could enter a few competitions and do some recitals.

<strong>Becca:</strong> I got started with Bella Tromba about four years ago. I had been playing with Vickie in a big band and she invited me along to play with the group. It was very nice to be a part of an ensemble that are excited by all types of music. They focused not just on playing the music but on how to introduce audiences to new music and engage with people.

<strong>Emma: </strong>I joined the group in 2012. I was at Trinity Music College and I heard that the girls had been in touch with the Head of Brass to ask if anyone played Bass Trumpet. He said to me, ‘Emma, you now play the Bass Trumpet’!

When you play bass trumpet in an orchestra there are a lot of bars rest but in a chamber group you can really say exactly what you want and you get tunes!

<strong> </strong>

<strong>2. What have you done as a group/individually to get to where you are today? Any secrets for success? </strong>

<strong>Becca: </strong>I always have a goal that I am fighting towards. Sometimes the goal changes and that can be a good thing. I think knowing yourself as a person and what you want to be as a musician is important. You should keep your individuality alive whatever situation you are in.

I think it’s very important an ensemble connects on a personal level as well as a musical level. Although we are four very different people we are a tight group of friends and we respect and take on board each other’s comments and musical ideas.

Some people like to interpret others music, some to improvise but for me music creation is a part of myself as a musician. I don’t think Silent Night is a piece that trumpets should always be <em>tacet </em>in! I like to arrange other people’s music and give it a new personality.

<strong>Vickie: </strong>I remember my Granddad taking me to watch Mahler 5 with the Halle orchestra age 8 and being captivated and wide awake!

Moving from the North of England to London I found that playing in a brass band had helped me enormously. The sense of community within a brass band is so important.  Helping each other to learn the notes and learn a new piece together and listening to each other are skills that have moved across to the quartet.

Playing with a group of friends is more fun than by yourself and you can experience adventures across the world with them by your side. Most musicians I meet have a real drive towards making music as fun as they can, they live and breathe music.

<strong>Jo: </strong>Loved music more than anything else! It’s a gift to be nurtured and cared for. I feel very blessed to be a trumpet player. Whatever struggle you are going through cling on to that and it will see you through!

<strong>Emma: </strong>Just owning a bass trumpet, spending time learning the repertoire and being a part of Bella Tromba has helped me to become known as a bass trumpet player<strong>. </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong><strong>3. What do you love about being a female brass player?</strong>

<strong>Vickie:</strong> In this day and age the male stereotype is diminishing so we don’t notice the divide as much as we did in the past. I have really enjoyed working with young female musicians, inspiring young players to continue and even to consider it as a career. Being a musician is the most fun and diverse career and I would say go for it! You get to experience so much as a chamber group, traveling playing repertoire that is close to your heart and performing in different venues.

<strong>Jo: </strong>Just being myself and enjoying my playing!

<strong>Becca: </strong>I don’t know what it’s like to be a male brass player! I have never really thought about it!

<strong>Emma</strong>: I don’t think it matters that I am a girl. I don’t notice a difference and I don’t feel that I have a role as a female player.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>4. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician? Do you have any advice for young female musicians? </strong>

<strong>Jo: </strong>Performing at the International Women’s Brass Conference with Bella Tromba in 2010 was a life changing experience for me. I suddenly understood how I had been shaped by learning in a predominantly male environment. Everyone at IWBC was so friendly, welcoming and entrepreneurial. I understood that the reason I had invested so much time and energy in Bella Tromba was because it was a place where I could be myself and thrive.

I do have a tendency to want to bond with younger female brass players and support them because I wish someone had done that for me. My new role models are Emma and Becca though. They just don’t see a difference in male and female players, they weren’t brought up being singled out for being a girl. Their experience has been radically different from mine and so their aspirations are inspiring for me.

<strong>Becca:</strong> I don’t think about having a specific role as a female musician, I think things are different now. My advice to female musicians would be to be self-aware and confident even if you are not outgoing or a proper lad. Confidence will drive you forward. Just be your own person and everyone will respect you for who you are.

<strong>Emma: </strong>There are a lot more male brass player and in any job, we should be striving towards equality. I teach a lot of girls and boys. I grew up in Cornwall and men and women both play brass instruments

&nbsp;

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?</strong>

<strong>Becca: </strong>Learning something that you think you will never use can still be very useful. Even if it isn’t the direction you want to be heading in just be open to learning.

<strong>Vickie:</strong> If I could tell my younger self something it would be that it is OK not to want to be an orchestral player. I knew it wasn’t the path I wanted to go down even though the Guildhall School of Music wanted to push me in that direction.

<strong>Jo: </strong>So much! But you never stop learning and every new experience shapes you so it’s ok to go through battles or make mistakes. I would just want younger players to enjoy their playing. If they really do have a burn that means they can’t imagine doing anything else but playing then go all out and be strong, you’ll make it through and it is worth it.

<strong>Emma: </strong>Practice! Just have fun, I still have fun every day.

.

<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc. </strong>

<strong>Jo: </strong>Ensemble playing, learning repertoire you feel a connection with, watching concerts and seeing musicians you admire at work is a wonderful place to start. All that will charge you with ideas and motivation.

And hymn tunes, I love hymn tunes! They are great for breathing, sound, transposition, swopping between instruments, playing musically… just about anything!

I find Paul Archibald’s <em>Breathe</em> books and the <em>Clarke </em>studies a really good way to start my practice.

<strong>Emma: </strong>If you want to be a bass trumpet player you really need to know the orchestral repertoire. Obviously, all the Wagner and Rite of Spring but also more contemporary stuff like Schoenberg.

<strong>Vickie: </strong>I have never stopped practicing the Arban!

<strong>Becca: </strong>Social media is such a useful resource! No matter what network you belong to, there are musicians all over the world that you can connect with. YouTube is great for discovering new music, exploring different genres and even collaborations. Bella Tromba have started to upload ‘play along’ videos. We want to become part of a worldwide community of musicians.

		<title>Five Habits Musicians Should Practice Daily - Michelle Bingheim</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This week's Five Things Friday reveals a new perspective in the Brass Chicks community - featuring a post from Michelle Bingheim, a trumpet player and music therapy student, on five habits we should all practice every day.</em>

<img class=" size-medium wp-image-1595 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/michelle.jpg?w=225" alt="michelle" width="225" height="300" />

Michelle Bingheim is currently a senior at Western Illinois University. Michelle comes from a musical family and developed a love for music at a young age.  She began her music study with piano, but the trumpet eventually won her over.  Michelle continues to study trumpet and participate in ensembles while earning her degree in music therapy.  She enjoys performing with a variety of ensembles and has developed a special love for playing in brass ensembles/bands.  Michelle plans to become a board certified music therapist upon graduation and serve clients in a special education setting while still pursuing her love of playing trumpet. Outside of music, Michelle enjoys consuming coffee, binge-watching Netflix, spending time with her family, being active at her church, and giving back to her community.

<strong>1. Self-Care:</strong>

Making/taking time for self-care is extremely important.  This topic is important for all professionals, especially for musicians.  Self-care is important because it helps us strengthen our minds and our bodies.  If our minds and bodies aren’t in the best condition possible, then we cannot perform at our highest level.  Self-care is different for every person.  For some, it may mean starting the day off with a run or going to the gym.  For others, it may mean incorporating healthy eating habits into the day, taking time to read, or watching an episode (or two) of Netflix.  Personally, one of the best things that I like to do for self-care is to start my morning off with a cup of coffee.  While this may seem small, that cup of coffee helps me to get in the right frame of mind for my day of classes, rehearsals, meetings, and homework.

<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Individual Practice Time:</strong>

While this may sound like a “common sense” thing to do every day, it can be difficult at times during the semester to make time for individual daily practice, especially as a non-performance major.  I oftentimes find myself focused on assignments for classes or busy with 4 hours of rehearsals. This is often when individual practice time can head to the wayside.  On the days when I am crazy busy and take even a tiny bit of time for individual practice, it helps to keep me on track and remind me of my goals.  With the idea of individual practice time also comes the idea of being efficient, especially on those days when you don’t have as much time as you would like.  On the days when you have a limited amount of time to practice, plan ahead and choose to work on the things that need the most attention!

<strong>3. Listen to Music</strong>

This may sound like another “common sense” point, but it is often hard to put into practice. A nice time to listen to the repertoire that you are working on is while you are resting your face during those individual practice sessions.  When you’re practicing and your face gets tired or you’re feeling unfocused, take some time for the horn to be off of your face and listen to a recording of whatever you’re working on.  If there isn’t a recording, use the piano and sing your part.  It is important to listen to the repertoire while we work to improve it; doing so helps you with interval training and intonation, as well as overall musicality.  Another method of listening is to put headphones in and play along with the recording. Try playing along with several different recordings to develop a broader sense of musicianship and technique. Always keep in mind that just because you listen to a certain recording, it doesn’t mean that the recording is correct. Do not rely on recordings to learn the music; learn the notes and rhythms first and then listen to the recordings.

It is also important to listen to music for enjoyment.  Each person has a different taste in music, but it is important to listen to other styles/genres of music that you don’t normally perform, because it allows you to become a more well-rounded musician and individual. If you play classical music all day, give yourself a break and listen to other genres you enjoy. This helps to keep music making and listening fresh and fun!

<strong>4. Surround Yourself with Positivity</strong>

In junior/senior high school, I was fortunate enough to attend Illinois Summer Youth Music and work with the family of Ronald Romm, a founding member of the Canadian Brass and a phenomenal trumpet player.  I remember Ron telling us that his office at the University of Illinois was full of positive quotes/affirmations, but I didn’t believe it until I saw it for myself.  The idea of “I am a great player,” instead of “I will be a great player” changed my work ethic and how I approached music.  When we surround ourselves with positive affirmations, we begin to be more confident and less timid.  Surrounding yourself with positivity allows you to live a more productive life and have a better outlook on your playing. Try printing off positive quotes from Pinterest and taping them up in a collage on your wall so that you see them every morning before you leave for classes.

<strong>5. Remember the “WHY”</strong>

Begin with the end in mind; keep your goals in the forefront of your mind.  It is important to remember where we are headed so that we stay on track.  None of the things mentioned above matter if we don’t have a plan, or if we don’t know why we are putting in all of this work.  When we are stressed and our bodies are tired after playing for several hours, we have to remind ourselves of the end goal.  It is important to remember why we have taken this path of being a musician and why each of us loves making music. Keep finding new ways to stay inspired and never give up. Progress is not linear; it takes time and dedication. Always remember the phrase, “two steps forward, one step back.” You might not be happy with where you are now, but we all have bad days now and then. It might seem like we’re moving slowly; but that’s alright! It takes a lot of time to become a professional and seasoned musician; however, with the proper motivation and time-management, all of us can reach our goals faster than we think.]]></content:encoded>

Alia attended the Summer Brass Institute in ’12 and ’13. As a fellow she collaborated with Joseph Alessi, principal trombone of the New York Philharmonic, Øystein Baadsvik, international tuba soloist, and Thomas Hooten, principal trumpet of Los Angeles Philharmonic. Alia is a graduate of the New England Conservatory where she majored in Trumpet Performance and performed with NEC’s Philharmonia, Wind Ensembles, Opera, Jazz and Chamber Orchestras. Committed to education, Alia teaches trumpet at the Harmony Program, a program whose mission is to reach underserved communities in New York City public schools. She is the trumpet faculty at Cazadero Music Camp in California. Her principal teachers include Catherine Murtagh, Michael Sachs, principal trumpet of the Cleveland Orchestra, Ben Wright of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Tom Siders of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Kevin Cobb of the American Brass Quintet. Alia is currently pursuing her MM and DMA in trumpet performance at Stony Brook University, studying with Kevin Cobb.</blockquote>

1. Get used to the comments and questions</h4>
“A woman playing trumpet? Is that common?” Men AND women have asked me this. My response has been the same since I was in fifth grade, “Well, if you can believe it or not, women also have lips, lungs, fingers, and a brain”. The seemingly never-ending comments and questions about being a female brass player have never gotten me down. I actually feel bad for the person asking. Why does someone think that you can’t do something you love because of your gender?? Beats me. “You play pretty good for a girl!” makes my eyes roll so far in the back of my head that I can see my brain. In the 1970’s and 1980’s, auditioning committees started using a screen to create “blind auditions”. What a great concept. No one can see that you are a woman. Until judges started noticing what heels sounded like…
<h4>2. Everything is going to be at least 10x harder for you</h4>
Lets face it - it’s a boys club. Helen Kotas was the first female brass player to hold a rostered position in a major symphony orchestra. She held the principal horn position in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1941-1947. That’s ninety nine years after the New York Philharmonic was established (1842). The first female trumpet player to join a major symphony orchestra was Marie Speziale in 1964 (Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra). First female trombone player was Betty S. Glover in 1952 (Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra). First female tuba player was Carol Jantsch in 2006 (Philadelphia Orchestra). You will always have to jump through more hoops because you are a woman. If you keep your head up and keep yourself driven towards your goals, this will make you a stronger player and person. Don’t limit your challenges; challenge your limits.
<h4>3. Don’t sell yourself short</h4>
Be confident.

Practice hard and efficiently.

Over prepare.

You are a woman and you play brass - that’s awesome! Don’t let someone else diminish your self worth. Be the <i>best</i> you can be for <i>yourself</i>.
<h4>4. You will probably be the only woman in your section</h4>
In a recent orchestra rehearsal the only other female brass player turned to me with a big smile on her face and said, “We’re the only women!”. I replied with a “Heck yeah!!” and made the “We Can Do It!” fist. In a room of 11 men we were there to be part of the section, we were there to make music, we were there to kick brAss.

I was on the subway in NYC going to a gig with my trumpet case when a little girl came up to me and asked what instrument I play. When I told her trumpet, she looked at me with furrowed eyebrows and told me that when she went to Jazz at Lincoln Center a few nights before, she didn’t see any women on stage so she assumed that women weren’t allowed to play jazz or brass instruments.

The next time you look at a picture of a symphony orchestra, jazz/brass band or wind ensemble - imagine all the men in the brass section gone. What do you see? The entire brass section missing? Being that one woman playing a shiny instrument in the back will inspire girls everywhere.
<h4>5. Expect nothing.</h4>
After playing <i>A Short Ride on a Fast Machine </i>by John Adams for a wind ensemble concert, we were walking off the stage as the audience applauded. The guest conductor was at the stage door and shaking the performer’s hands as we filled through the backstage door. When I got to the conductor he put his hand behind his back and didn’t look at me. I was the only woman in the trumpet section. Later, the usual conductor of this same ensemble verified this man’s behavior as historically sexist.

It can get very frustrating having to deal with people that want the brass world to remain a boys club. “It’s a man eat man world”… let them eat themselves.

You are seen.

You are appreciated.

You are awesome.

You inspire.

<h1>Interview</h1>

<hr />

<strong>1. How long have you been teaching privately, and how long as a college professor? What do you love about teaching horn? Any favorite teaching moments?</strong>

I started teaching privately when I was still in high school.  I didn’t have more than one or two students, and I wasn’t very good, but it was a great learning experience.  This is my second year teaching horn at Texas State University, I also taught at SUNY Potsdam’s Crane School of Music for a semester in 2014.  I love teaching people about music and helping them to be better musicians, the horn is just the medium to make that music.  I live for the moment where students start to own their musical decisions, when they reach the point in their studies where their fundamental skills are strong enough for them to realize their musical voice on the instrument.  As a teacher, it is so hard to watch students struggle through technical problems, but the best part is seeing students in real time start to master those techniques.  You can literally see a light bulb turn on and, suddenly, everything starts to make sense to them and they start to draw more connections.  I love those moments!

<strong>2. You recently moved from Michigan to Texas to begin teaching at Texas State University. Have you noticed any significant differences between the music worlds in the Midwest and in Texas? If so, what are they?</strong>

I haven’t noticed significant differences, people are teaching music in many of the same ways here in Texas as they do in Michigan, but everything is on a much bigger scale.  There are many large school districts closer to the cities, but there are also many small communities across the state.  Texas is a large state (you think you know how big it is, but you don’t really know until you start driving in Texas), and there are many different regions, cultures, traditions, and backgrounds represented.  All of these reasons make it difficult to prepare future educators to teach in Texas.

I tried early on to learn as much as I could about things like their all-state audition process and solo contests, that was a huge learning curve.  It is very normal here in Texas for students to work on the same etudes for All-State auditions for 4-6 months, and when students start studying music at the collegiate level it seems to take a little while to get them used to working on more material over a shorter time span.  I didn’t know about this when I started last year, so that was something I had to figure out and learn how to accommodate better.

<strong>3. How did you build your current studio? Namely, how have you gone about recruiting students, creating a strong studio dynamic, and so on? </strong>

I’m still in the process of building my studio and I always will be, but I was fortunate to start last school year with 15 strong horn players.  When you are new, retention of students is always hard to negotiate because they didn’t come to that school to study with you, so part of last year was very intentionally getting to know each student: their playing, their interests.  I tried to communicate at all times that my job was to help them accomplish their goals and to support them.  Most of the strong studio dynamic I inherited from my predecessor, Steve Hager, and I owe him a great deal!  My students are great people, hard workers, incredibly smart and caring, and interested in learning.  I couldn’t ask for a better studio to get started with!

I also have to think about future students.  I give clinics, adjudicate local all-state auditions, and say ‘yes’ to anything that the Texas Music Educators Association offers me.  I won a couple auditions last year with local orchestras, which helped to make more connections with private teachers in the area.  This sounds much more strategic than it really is, it really boils down to being genuine and seeking out opportunities. I obviously still have quite a bit of work to do in this area, but I have been very fortunate in getting some great opportunities early on that have made me more visible to potential students.

<strong>4. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician? </strong>

This is a great question, and I’m not sure if I have a great answer at the moment.  When I was younger, it never dawned on me that being a woman and a brass player was ever a big deal.  Later when I was auditioning for graduate programs, I made it a point to seek out a woman to study with, because I realized I had never studied with anyone more like me.  I had always studied with men who were tall and didn’t have to worry about things like lung capacity!

Being a bit older now and seeing more of the music world, I see my role as a woman, as someone who still isn’t represented equally in the orchestra and especially in universities, as a very important role now.  While I can never truly understand what another person is going through, by being underrepresented in my field, I have more empathy for others who are underrepresented.  I can influence my students to be more empathetic towards others and I can help to change the canon of horn literature to include music by underrepresented composers.  I can encourage my students to listen to more of a wider range of musicians.  Because of my experiences as a woman in the brass field I can’t turn a blind eye to the future of other underrepresented musicians, and I do feel a responsibility to doing everything I can to help make their journey easier.

<strong>5. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?</strong>

Teaching and preparing students for the future of music and music education is a big talking point in higher education at the moment.  There are some obvious changes occurring in music today, and while there are always scary articles and commenters that talk about how classical music is “dead,” I believe this is an exciting time to be a musician!  Because of technology, social media, easier access to recording, etc, musicians can be diverse, entrepreneurial, interested in crossing art forms, and they are only limited by their imaginations.  As an educator of these future musicians, I feel I need to help them see what interests they have beyond the horn and to try to help them realize how those interests could come together to form a future career.  We need to hustle more in today’s musical climate, we have to want to work harder every day and seek out more opportunities (and possibly create new opportunities).  The great news is that, no matter how niche or even brand new our interests and passions are, there is a way to live and thrive as musicians.  There will be people that share our interests, there will be future students that are inspired by something brand new, and, before we know it, something that was on the fringe suddenly has momentum and recognition!  Today’s musician has to be more fearless and more creative, and as a teacher it’s my job to help instruct and inspire people to rise to those challenges.

On a more practical level, I love talking to my students about how to manage their lives better.  Time management is incredibly important, not just to make sure everything gets done, but with their limited time I try to stress that they shouldn’t ever waste time in a practice room by not having a plan (daily and weekly goals).  Through lessons, recitals, and concerts, there are opportunities to talk about self-promotion, having a website, making posters, having a clear vision for their musical ideas, and knowing how to manage their finances.  I was lucky that I was taught how to manage a budget when I was much younger, but I’m as addicted to budgeting as anyone can be.  If my students graduate from Texas State and all they learned was how to have a savings goal, I will be happy!

<strong>6. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

I’m lucky to be in a position where I can effect change, because everything I wish I had learned at a younger age I can now teach to my students.  I wish someone had taught me how to practice more efficiently when I was younger, so I try to emphasize that quite a bit with my students.  I injured myself multiple times because I didn’t know how to break up etudes and practice sessions into manageable units, I had to learn that through a lot of trial and error.  So now I talk to my students about that in their lessons, we talk about practice techniques, I have them keep practice journals to organize their goals and their thoughts about each practice session.  I communicate to them that they don’t have to spend hours and hours in a practice room working on one Kopprasch etude if they can focus on very small and very specific challenges in each practice session.  I ask my students questions in every lesson about how they thought their performance of whatever musical example went, and if they had a few more days to practice it, what they would improve and how they would improve it.  There are also many more resources about practicing and learning music, people who seem to have had similar struggles and they spent their time researching and writing about the most effective and efficient ways to learn music.

I hope that younger female musicians understand that they don’t have to be “better” than a male musician.  I want them to know that their opportunities are truly unlimited, and while they may still be underrepresented, there is a place for them if they are willing to be brave and to place themselves in situations where they may feel like an outsider.  I do hope that the musical world makes faster strides to be more open and accommodating to everyone, but until that happens, we all need to encourage each other, to help each other, to listen to each other, and to support each other.

<strong>7. Any resources you recommend? For example, are there any books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life, etc? </strong>

Genevieve frequently performs with orchestras, quintets, school ensembles and marching/pep bands. Noteworthy clients include The Pennington School and Patriot Brass Ensemble. Genevieve teaches private and small group lessons in central New Jersey. Orchestras that Genevieve has performed with include Shen Yun Symphony Orchestra, Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra, Sinfonietta Nova and Gateway Classical Music Society. Outside of music, Genevieve teaches Japanese and pursues her interest in technology.</blockquote>
Thanks Genevieve for sharing your thoughts with the Brass Chicks community! <!--more-->

<hr />

You're at a gig, you can hear and feel that something isn't right with your playing. The licks that you had once conquered are now foreign, your face does not feel as comfortable as it should, the sounds coming out of your horn do not match the timing and style of others in the ensemble.  You think back to your college days when you were performing and practicing all day everyday and you wonder, if you could do it then, why can't you do it now?

These skills are fine-tuned and become second nature with frequent use but they will slip away if they are not nurtured. Most music students don't have full-time performance jobs waiting for them after college. If you are in the minority, lucky you! If you are in the majority, here are five ways to keep your chops in shape after college.

Personally, I have skills in technology that allow me to work a flexible job 40 hours a week, so I am writing from that perspective. School teaching, a profession that many of my colleagues pursue, is often a rewarding career for musicians but it rarely offers the luxury of a flexible schedule. Finding a job that allows you to keep performing should be taken into consideration when pursuing a career path. Be aware of your limits and energy levels, do not burn yourself out by trying to balance too many commitments.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Encourage</strong></li>
</ol>
Do whatever you must to keep the love of your instrument alive. Clean it, play cheesy pop tunes on it, take selfies with it, etc. Make your practice space somewhere special, a place where you look forward to spending time.
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Maintain</strong></li>
</ol>
This is broken into another five things. After a good warm up using either The Brass Gym or Julie Landsman's Carmine Caruso exercises, my practice sessions consist of five key goals.
<ol>
	<li>Scales. Alan Baer's Cross Training and Tonic Dominant Scales are my bread and butter here. Scales need to be as second nature as the skills I mentioned above.</li>
	<li>Lyrical etude. I like the Johannes Rochut etudes. I use the trombone books because tuba players are frequently asked to read up an octave. Frequenting trombone repertoire will make this skill second nature.</li>
	<li>Technical etude. I use Kopprasch etudes and Arban exercises for this. When you become proficient at technical etudes, combined with scales as a second nature, technical passages will fear you!</li>
	<li>C tuba excerpt.</li>
	<li>F tuba excerpt.</li>
</ol>
I adjust these concepts as necessary depending on specific goals but I always go back to these five when I feel lost in my practice journey. That being said...
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Back to Basics</strong></li>
</ol>
In the real world of balancing part time performance and part time "pay the bills" jobs, practice sessions will most likely be shorter and less frequent than what you were used to in school. Don't be afraid to spend these shorter/sporadic sessions entirely on basics. A little bit is better than nothing! Additionally, when I'm traveling with my tubas, I don't always have the ability to break out my music stand and books, so I keep a solid routine of warm ups and basics memorized.
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Improve</strong></li>
</ol>
The most efficient way to improve is to record yourself! If you have mentors or colleagues to share these recordings with, that is even better. Everything sounds different in front of the horn, and in different spaces, which is why recording is crucial. I have learned so much about my note shapes and intonation tendencies by listening to my recordings. Personally, I always perform better in front of an audience so knowing that my friends will hear the recordings encourages me to strive for brilliance.
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Connections</strong></li>
</ol>
Keep your connections, and make new connections, by going to events. Get your name and face out there by attending concerts, master classes, reunions, etc. The more you promote yourself and remind people that you are still performing/teaching in the area, the more opportunities and gigs you will get.

Remember, EMBIC:

Encourage, Maintain, Back to Basics, Improve, Connections.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Interview</h2>

<hr />

<strong>1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do.</strong>
I am originally from a small town called Roaonke Rapids in NC. (Don’t think anyone has heard of this town, haha.) I have been living in NYC for almost 20 years. I moved to NY to become a performer and work on Broadway. I have been fortunate to have worked as a performer/musician throughout most of my 20 years in NY. I mostly do musical theatre and play trumpet with bands on and off. It hasn’t always been easy, but I love what I do.

I recently just finished the National tour of <em>Cabaret, </em>where I had worked for the past year and a half. What a ride that was. I got to play trumpet, French horn, euphonium, and even the accordion. I was also a swing, which means I covered all the female ensemble roles, I was the understudy for the role of Fraulein Kost, and I was also the dance captain. Throughout that time, I had the joy of working with Music Director Patrick Vaccariello, who has been a mentor and inspiration to me. It has been a very busy year and a half!!

<strong>2. What do you love about being a female actor? What about being a female brass player?</strong>
Hummm. These are a couple of tough questions to answer. What I like about being a female brass player is that when I walk into a room or play a gig it’s unexpected. People assume women don’t play brass... women should play woodwind instruments. So that's kinda cool, to blow people away with playing brass. Plus I think it’s sexy.

<strong>3. How has instrumental music played a role in your life since you began to pursue a career in theatre?</strong>
I guess you could say I have finally found my “niche” in my career in theatre. There seems to be a trend within the past 15 years in theatre that you have to play an instrument as well as sing, dance, and act. You have to be a quadruple threat. The revival of Cabaret in 98’ directed by Sam Mendes and choreographed by Rob Marshall was unique in the sense that the cast was the orchestra and played on stage. This was my first big show and I got cast because I happen to also be a musician who plays trumpet and French horn. I got lucky!!! However, it wasn’t easy to land this show; I auditioned for over a year before I got cast. Grueling, to say the least. I was very young and “green,” but I kept being persistent and never gave up because I knew this show was perfect for me.

Since <em>Cabaret,</em> there have been more musicals that require the cast to be quadruple threats. Director John Doyle, for example, likes to have his actors play instruments. He has directed <em>Company</em> and <em>Sweeney Todd,</em> which required all actors to play an instrument of some sort.

I have also done a lot of productions of <em>The Buddy Holly Story</em> where I play piano and trumpet, and also <em>Ring Of Fire</em> (Johny Cash), where I play guitar and stand up bass. So I am not the typical traditional musical theatre performer. I like to challenge myself and force myself to do as much as possible. I tend to go for shows that are more edgy.

<strong>4. How did you end up playing brass as well as acting, singing, and dancing in the recent Cabaret national tour? What did that job listing and audition look like? Additionally, how often were you practicing brass instruments before you got involved with this Cabaret production?</strong>
Let’s see. I got interested in music and theatre at a very early age. Started taking dance lessons at 5 years old and then I started taking piano lessons in the third grade. And then in the fifth grade I wanted to play the French Horn. However, at my school the band director said French Horn was too hard and I had to play the trumpet for a year. I wasn’t completely happy about that, but I am glad I learned the trumpet. Right after that year I switched to French Horn and played throughout my teenage years and actually had a scholarship to play French Horn in college. I was a busy young adult juggling band, dance, sports, and community theatre. Thankfully, I have a very supportive family in everything I do. I am very fortunate to have such great parents.

In college I was a double major in music and also musical theatre with a minor in dance. Then I decided to just be a musical theatre major and not French Horn. I wanted to be a starving actor, I guess.

When I moved to NY in ’97, I had $1,000 to my name, but I got lucky and booked a show called Hello Dolly. I was just in the ensemble but was thrilled to book my first show out of NY. Then I saw the ad for <em>Cabaret</em> which read something like this:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>{seeking female/male actors who can sing and dance and also can play one of the following instruments... trumpet, violin, banjo, piano, sax, clarinet, and cello}</em></p>
So I auditioned for <em>Cabaret</em>. I thought for sure I would get cast immediately... nope, I was wrong! Little did I know, it would take over a year to get cast. The audition process was insane! We had to sing, dance, read sides, and then play our instruments.

At that time I wasn’t playing my instruments much at all. I had to dust the cobwebs off a little. I remember getting my embouchure back into shape and thinking my lips were going to fall off my face!!!

But I booked the national tour in 2000 and then in 2002 I booked <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway for my Broadway debut! I had the wonderful pleasure of getting to be the understudy for Sally Bowles in the show. What a dream come true. Then I recently booked the revival tour in 2016.

I remember the first day of rehearsal back in 2000 and the musical director asked me if I played euphonium and I said no... but I learned how! And now I am obsessed with the euphonium. It's such a cool brass instrument and so much fun to play.

<strong>4.Are there any significant psychological differences for you between instrumental performance and theatrical performance? How do you prepare to perform, and does it change based on what kind of performance you are doing?</strong>
Absolutely, there are differences between preparing for instrumental and theatrical performances. When preparing for instrumental gigs, I have to warm up my instrument and do long tones and get my embouchure ready to play. When preparing for theatrical performances, I have to warm up my body, my voice, and get mentally prepared for the role. I feel it’s more time consuming warming up for a theatrical performance. That is why <em>Cabaret</em> was so challenging: I had to prepare for both before every show.

<strong>5. Is there anything you wish you had known as a student or young professional thatl you know now? Any advice that you’d like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

Hummmm. I wish I would have known how hard it was going to be. I knew it was going to be tough and lots of competition, but goodness, I had no idea.

My advice is to practice every day and ALWAYS be yourself and true to who you are. "Compare" leads to "despair." There is only one you, and no one can be as great as you. Don’t try to fit the mold that the casting director or musical director wants to put you into. Just be yourself, be persistent, be brave, be bold, and never give up. Oh, yeah, and discipline helps as well.

<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? For example, are there any books, podcasts, recordings, etc, that changed your life?</strong>
The one thing that changed my life and made me realize I wanted to be a French horn/brass player was a recording of The Planets, by Gustav Holst. The moment I heard this recording I knew I wanted to play French horn.

Now I listen to a lot of jazz, New Orleans funk, and old-school hip hop. I say, listen to anything that makes you feel good or moves you.]]></content:encoded>

<hr />

<h3>5. Prokofiev Symphony No. 5</h3>
Prokofiev’s fifth is a whirlwind of lush and colourful sounds with many moments that are strange and even carnival-like. Sergei wove together many a good vibe in this one. Though the whole piece is worth hearing and a rollicking good time to perform, the finale is a banger for the ages.

https://open.spotify.com/album/7uYhVkvxwhxG1nrVXDVnE6
<h3>4. Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 5</h3>
<img class="  wp-image-1967 alignright" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/22522176_10209765268023473_542716553_o-e1507927440726.jpg" alt="Tchaikovsky in a Horn" width="225" height="232" />As a horn player I am legally required to adore Tchaik 5. The horn solo is the second movement is love and feared in equal measure by hornists everywhere, and is one of the most beautiful and emotionally moving solos in the orchestral repertoire. Throughout the work there are drama, beautiful melodies, and a lot of great writing for brass, with many a headbanging moment. On the whole, Tchaikovsky’s 5th symphony is a beautiful work of art and performing it is a great experience.

https://open.spotify.com/user/brasschicks/playlist/6BoQh1sOqqR2Wwnd446sBz
<h3>3. Mahler Symphony No. 5</h3>
This is the only one on the list that I have yet to play, and I hope to rectify this ASAP as possible, as it is a magnificent work of art. As brass players we owe Mahler so much, both due to the top-tier quality of his writing and how often he expanded the number of players in the section. Mahler 5 has 6 horns (plus corno obligato), four trumpets, three trombones and tuba, giving woodwind and string players everywhere a good reason to invest in good earplugs lest the magnificence proves to be too much for their ears. Mahler 5 is one of the most recognizable Mahler works and the writing for brass is fantastic. The opening ??? LEGENDARY. The horn solos? Hell yeah. The fact that there are 5 movements? Iconic. Gustav brings the drama.

https://open.spotify.com/album/5ENEAfJFQNuvww1jxjcnbu
<h3>2. Beethoven Symphony No. 5</h3>
Possibly the most universally recognizable opening in the orchestral canon is the iconic theme of Beethoven’s 5th, which has been an absolute BANGER for over 200 years. Though Beethoven’s third is what changed the game of what a symphony was, I like to think that his 5th symphony is where he earned his place as the god of the symphony that we remember him as. First movement: drama, energy, angst. Second Movement: regal, beautiful, sweet. Third movement: Sick horn entrance, more drama, struggle between light and dark. Finale: GLORY, JOY, TIMPANI, TROMBONE, UNBRIDLED EXCITEMENT AND CELEBRATION. Beethoven 5 is truly iconic and a shining star of the Western classical canon.

https://open.spotify.com/user/brasschicks/playlist/5f3zR1P15izlcNeiX2sb8X
<h3>1. Shostakovich Symphony No. 5</h3>
Shostakovich 5 will always have a special (and angsty) place in my heart; it was this first symphony I ever performed and one of the reasons I have tinnitus. Are other 5th symphonies better written than Shosty 5? Maybe, but I am not qualified to make that distinction and I don’t really care. I am a simple woman, I like music that gets loud and dramatic and angry and has just a wall of brass and percussion at the end and Shostakovich delivers in this respect. Every movement (even the third movement in which dear Dmitri gifted us brass folks with a chance to rest our chops before the explosive finale) is a Jam with a capital J and I will fight anyone who disagrees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are excited to continue our new series featuring women brass players who push boundaries and play outside the box of a standard path for a "conservatory trained musician." Our first interview features trombonist Natalie Cressman, whom Kate has met freelancing in NYC and it was such a pleasure to read her responses.</em>

<img class="  wp-image-2014 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/7302c6_07ff388914e74c3ba9455dac1d0f20f3.jpg?w=1024" alt="7302c6_07ff388914e74c3ba9455dac1d0f20f3" width="333" height="257" />Possessing a voice as cool and crystalline as an Alpine stream, <strong>Natalie Cressman </strong>is a rising singer/ songwriter and trombonist who draws inspiration from a vast array of deep and powerful musical currents. Her new five-song EP <strong>Traces </strong>reveals her latest evolution, a sleek and sensuous electronica-laced sound with even a trace or two of dance floor sweat. Steadily evolving in many directions, the 25-year-old Cressman has already put down deep roots in several overlapping scenes. A prodigiously talented New York City-based trombonist, she’s spent the past seven years touring the jam band circuit as a horn player and vocalist with <strong>Phish</strong>'s <strong>Trey Anastasio </strong>(and recently played with Phish at <strong>Madison Square Garden</strong>). Deeply versed in Latin jazz, post-bop, pop, and Brazilian music, she tapped the interlaced traditions on her first two solo albums, 2012’s <strong>Unfolding </strong>and 2014’s <strong>Turn the Sea</strong>. <strong>The Traces EP </strong>follows on the heels of 2016’s <strong>Etchings in Amber</strong>, a gorgeous duo album with guitarist <strong>Mike Bono </strong>that introduced Cressman as a formidable musical force without her horn. While the project focuses on songs featuring lyrics she wrote for several Bono compositions, Cressman also wrote words and music for three of her songs, contributing to the atmospheric suite of jazz-inflected, genre-bending tunes. With Traces, Cressman expands her creative reach into post-production, meticulously crafting soundscaped tracks. Her vocal work in increasingly intimate and rhythmically insinuating settings has revealed an artist who can thrive in any setting, from raucous, reverberant halls to packed and pulsing lofts and nightclubs. In an epoch marked by infinite musical possibilities, Natalie Cressman is a singular force who draws from an improbable breadth of sonic realms. Cressman is An artist endorser for <strong>King Trombones</strong>.

<strong>1. From your background in jazz and latin music to playing in the jam band scene with Phish and Trey Anastasio band, it certainly seems like you are a well rounded musician. How did you get started with your own work as a composer/singer-songwriter?</strong>

I started writing in high school here and there but I didn’t get fully into it until I moved to NYC to go to college and had opportunities every week to bring in original music and hear it played by my combo. <!--more--> At first I was writing mostly instrumental songs in the modern-jazz vein, but incorporated a lot of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian rhythmic and harmonic ideas. Those elements just kinda flowed naturally into my music, even when I was arranging standards or doing something more straight ahead. At that time I also was listening to a lot of Joni Mitchell and finding work by contemporary artists like Becca Stevens and Gretchen Parlato that took elements of more folk-based singer/songwriter styles and fused it with jazz. Being inspired by them is what really brought me into writing the way I do now, which is a lot more song-based and informed by the lyrics and vocal component.

<strong>2. How do you balance touring/working as a side-woman with your own daily maintenance on the trombone and your work with your own music as a singer songwriter?  Any secrets of success for fellow musicians balancing diverse interests and busy schedules?</strong>

It’s definitely a struggle to find time to maintain a routine while touring. And sometimes even when I’m in town, if I’m deep into a writing project and have a deadline coming up, or have to learn 15 songs for an upcoming gig, it’s also easy to let my practice routine fall by the wayside. I also play some other instruments (guitar, piano, and bass) that I try to maintain and improve my skills on by shedding too so I’m often left with the feeling that I wished there were more hours in the day.

But with the trombone, I try to stick to similar exercises for a few weeks at a time and then change up my routine every month or so to keep finding new things to work on. I then try touch on those concepts every day even if I’m on the road. Even if my schedule is absolutely insane I make sure to get at least 30 min in before I leave my house or if I’m on the road, allow for at least 30min before soundcheck to have some time to myself to get properly warmed up. I know that’s not a lot, but it’s an achievable goal and so much better than skipping a day and going straight to a gig or rehearsal without feeling warmed up and centered.  Especially if I’m on tour with Trey Anastasio, we often soundcheck for 1-2 hours and the show is around 3.5 hours long, so I am also trying not to tire out my chops by over-practicing on show days. I also like to come up with a routine made up of exercises that kill two birds with one stone - for instance,  where I’m working on slide coordination but in the context of a scale, mode, or pattern, that could also be applied to improvising or theory.

<strong>3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

That’s a great question. I do feel some sense of personal responsibility for whatever reason to prove preconceptions about female musicians wrong. Whether it’s from within the band, or the sound guy, or band management, or the audience, there are a lot of instances where my ability is underestimated or my knowledge/experience challenged and I have to say I’m pretty positive it’s because I’m a girl. So I guess I feel this responsibility to be as good as I can be and try and deal with those situations as gracefully as I can. I hope that by modeling professionalism I can change the stereotypes and make it easier for the next generation of female brass players to feel like they’re only being judged on their musical ability and not other superficial factors.

<strong>4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own or when teaching?</strong>

I think it’s incredibly difficult to make a living playing music, unless you’re interested in commercial and electronic music (and even then, though the path to success may be a little more defined, it’s still hard).  The music business today is so much more about image, social media engagement, and appeal to key demographics than the music that it can be kinda disheartening when starting your own project. But I’ve found opportunities to still be able to stay true to who I am musically while making a living by diversifying the kinds of music I play. I was trained to be a jazz musician, but I studied a lot of funk and rock repertoire and stylings and now I get a lot of work playing as a sidemen and special guest in more established bands, which allows me to fund my solo project and play shows with my band that might be more for the music’s sake than any kind of financial gain. I think especially for horn players this is a really great approach, but it kind of goes against what I was taught in music school, which was that it is better to be the best at 1 one thing/genre. I’ve found that being stylistically versatile has opened a lot of doors for me, though I may not be “the best” at any one thing. Everyone is different, as is everyone’s definition of success. For me, success is being able to make the music that makes me happy and the most inspired while being able to pay my bills and have a well-rounded life.

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

I wish that I had given myself permission to branch out from jazz a little earlier, and I attribute that largely to the institutional bias that jazz is the most sophisticated and therefore the best genre. That sense of musical superiority held me back from learning about other important American music not to mention musical traditions from outside of the U.S. It took me a couple years of being in NYC to readjust this value system I had been taught in music school and realize that there’s a LOT of really high quality music out there that has nothing to do with jazz. Harmonic sophistication is just one element out of so many ways that music can be rich and run deep and looking at the music world as a whole with an open mind only brought me to a greater variety of opportunities.

<strong>7. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.</strong>

Laurie Frink’s teaching method really changed my life in terms of brass technique. I was lucky to study with her while she was still alive but I know a lot of teaching materials about her method are floating around the internet and I really recommend checking it out. It helped me play in a healthy balanced way where I was able to endure long and loud gigs without hurting or burning out my chops. Her technique made it possible for me to maintain good technique no matter what the musical situation or nature of the music, so I could go straight from a New Orleans brass band gig to playing Brazilian choro for instance without any chop readjustments.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This week's Five Things Friday is by trumpeter and educator Sandy Coffin. I have known Sandy through freelancing in NYC and my recital at the International Women's Brass Conference was right around the same time as her presentation so it is great to feature Sandy's presentation with the Brass Chicks community in this format. </em>

<img class="  wp-image-2031 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandy.jpg" alt="Sandy - Version 2 – Version 3" width="262" height="353" />

<b><i>Sandy Coffin</i></b> is trumpet player who has performed all around the US and Europe, premiered several new pieces written especially for her, presented lecture-recitals on original 19thC instruments in both the UK and NYC this past year, is working on a recording project of ‘lost’ cornet solos, teaches Brass Band at a private school in NYC, tutors with the National Youth Brass Bands of Scotland Summer Course, has won a bunch of awards, created a successful concert series, just signed an arranging contract with a music publisher, has degrees from Oberlin and MSM—and still isn’t sure what to wear.

&nbsp;

<hr />

<em>Based on my presentation at the IWBC June 2017 at Rowan University and my interview with Christine Chapman, published in the Fall 2015 IWBC Newsletter.</em>

As women, we do not have a ‘default’ dress code; we do not have a standard equivalent to the ‘suit and tie.’ Women have a particularly wide range of fashion options when the dress code says ‘formal,’ but each option carries certain connotations. The choices have become increasingly complicated for everyone, both women and men, so how do we go about making informed and appropriate choices?

[Note: this is not really about orchestra attire – when given specific guidelines, follow them!]

I think it is important, <i>especially</i> in these complex times, to talk about some of these issues, and particularly about how we choose to physically present ourselves in our performances, photos, and social media / publicity materials.  I don’t believe there are any definitive answers, but hopefully talking about these things can help us all make educated choices – and allow us to excel in our performances.
<b></b>
<ol>
	<li><b>Can I actually play my best in this outfit? </b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Whatever you choose to wear, be sure you can breathe easily and fully, and can move as needed – to get on and off stage, for mute changes, instrument switches, page turns, choreography, managing interactive electronics, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If you choose to wear a cocktail dress and heels, be sure you feel grounded and balanced in your heels! (Low incline platform shoes are great for that.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Practice often in the outfit to be sure. Video record yourself from various audience perspectives to be sure you are really presenting the image you want to project.</li>
	<li>Be informed about the performance space and audience sight lines. You don’t want to be surprised by the angles people are looking from – and what they can see. Keep them focused on your performance, not your wardrobe.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
	<li><b> How do our clothing, hair, make-up choices impact how others perceive us (the individual and/or ensemble)? </b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Be aware of the story you want the audience to experience during your performance. You are not anonymous while producing sound on a stage. Wearing a cocktail dress and heels just because it seems to be the female equivalent of a man's suit (performance uniform) without being aware of the cultural signals such an outfit projects can be inappropriate on stage.</li>
	<li>Be aware that different regions bring different cultural norms to the table. You don’t have to change yourself to fit, but you always need to be as aware as possible of the context others will have as they interact with you.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li><b> How do they impact how we perceive ourselves?</b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Self-perception is an integral part of performance presentation. Do you feel comfortable? Exposed? Powerful? Vulnerable? You don’t want to be focused on what you are wearing – you want your energy to go into your performance.</li>
	<li>Learn what styles make you feel most in control of the situation, strong, and secure.</li>
	<li>Determine what brings you closest to your own self-image of a successful performer.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
	<li><b> What factors can we use to determine what the consequences of our clothing/appearance decisions might be? </b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Stay aware of the signals that some clothing was designed to project. Educate yourself. Talk with theater costume designers or fashion professionals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Choose the cocktail dress and heels if they make you feel good as a performer. But own the fact that a formal or sexy cocktail dress was designed to send signals about different things than a man's business suit was. (Their names say it all...)</li>
	<li>Aim for PERFORMANCE POWERFUL. It is great when a performer is aware of how an outfit can be perceived, including the hidden signals that may have little to do with the music, and intentionally chooses to present themselves in that framework because it makes them feel strong. Clothing choices that seem to be made in the hopes of distracting from performance difficulties are less great.</li>
	<li>Get feedback from others about your performance presence, but reflect on what makes you feel good on stage. You need to feel solid and grounded, strong and powerful, so spend time reflecting on what makes you feel best.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
	<li><b> Are you prepared to deal with the full range of consequences of those decisions, including comments and unsolicited behaviors from others, and success or failure that has little or nothing to do with the actual performance</b></li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>When you feel solid, grounded, strong and powerful, the audience will join you in feeling that.</li>
	<li>You must own the story that you are presenting to the audience. Tell that story as powerfully as you can. Clothing and makeup choices should serve as backdrops or props in the telling of that story, not simply a costume for yourself. Keep it all integrated.</li>
	<li>Remember that others are going to bring their own agendas and interpretations to that story. Plan in advance for what those might be, based on cultural allusions, your own experiences, and research into the experiences of others. You can’t control other people’s responses or behavior, but you can prepare yourself in advance on how you would deal with a variety of responses.</li>
</ul>

		<title>An Interview with Mariachi Flor de Toloache: NYC&#039;s First and Only All-Women Mariachi Group</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are excited to continue to interview trailblazing female musicians who continue to push boundaries and inspire musicians everywhere. This group has been on my radar for a while and it was so great to hear from Mireya from Mariachi Flor de Toloache - about her experiences with the group and changing the musical landscape.
</em>

<strong><img class="  wp-image-1800 alignleft" src="http://mariachinyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fdt_lg2017_nom_1.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="389" /></strong>

<em>Latin Grammy Nominees <a href="http://mariachinyc.com/">Mariachi Flor de Toloache</a> make New York City history as its’ First and Only All­-Women Mariachi Group. Founded in 2008, Mariachi Flor de Toloache is lead by singers Mireya I. Ramos (founder) &amp; Shae Fiol (founding member). Reminiscent of the early days of mariachi the group started as a trio, Harp, Violin and Vihuela. Today, Mariachi Flor De Toloache performs as a full Mariachi ensemble. The members hail from diverse cultural backgrounds such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Australia, Colombia, Germany, Italy and the United States. This defines their unique flavor and sound. The result of this cultural bouquet is an edgy, versatile and fresh take on traditional Mexican music. They coalesce as would a band of sisters, with a grace and vibrant beauty that casts a spell over their audiences not unlike the legendary Toloache flower still being used in Mexico as a love potion. While working to preserve centuries old traditions of Mariachi, their melange of the traditional and the modern pushes the boundaries of the genre and brings Mariachi music to new audiences.</em>

Read their complete bio <a href="http://mariachinyc.com/meet-las-flores">here </a>

<strong>1. From the Latin Grammy nomination to the upcoming and recent tours, Mariachi Flor de Toloache is extremely impressive as NYC’s first and only Mariachi group. Tell us about your experiences! Anything coming up soon?</strong>
<div id="m_-7753291609794714785AppleMailSignature">

It has been quite a beautiful and empowering adventure. We started in 2008 knowing we wanted to experiment with the tradition of mariachi which had been passed down by my dad. Little did we know that by being persistent, playing for tips, playing in the subway in the middle of winter, dealing with much criticism for not following the tradition as is, it would all lead to being nominated for our first self produced album then recently nominated again for our second album. It's definitely mind blowing how much you can accomplish when you're persistent, true to yourself, passionate and follow your vision. More important than the recognition of an award, is the continuous inspiration we spread to young girls and boys. Seeing them singing along to our songs and connecting to our music is priceless!

<!--more-->

Right now we are touring with legendary Cafetacvba which has been a dream of ours!

Then we start our west coast Day of the dead tour with La Santa Cecilia and Mexrissey <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Oct 27-Nov 3rd</span></span>

We end our tour at the Latin Grammys where we will be performing at the Ceremony accompanying Natalia Fourcade 11/16.

This week we were featured on the new release of Paul McCartneys Holidays Rule Vol.2. On one of the tracks titled- That's what I want for Christmas

<strong>2.  What have you done as a group/individually to get to where you are today? Any secrets for success?</strong>

I always suggest to just go out there and jam! That's the best school for music. I jammed a lot, sat in all over NYC. Would always show up to someone's gig with my instrument, performed, recorded and collaborated for free a lot to gain experience and make connections. I went out there and networked lots. I also tried to play as much different genres of music that I could taking advantage that I'm in a melting pot of a city.

I always say leave your ego at home, open your heart and just play music! There nothing like it! Also, finding &amp; creating your own sound, style and passion is important.

<strong>3. As fellow female musicians in a male dominated industry, do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players or mariachi musicians? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician? Do you have any advice for young female musicians? </strong>

What I've learned working with men is that you can't change their behavior or way of thinking over night. There are many ways to shine and still accomplish what you want.

We do have a responsibility to be aware that machismo exists in all cultures and that we as women need to have each other's back but to also be aware that we need to work on our dynamics - Woman to Woman. Once we brake that I think the change in men will happen organically with the new generations to come. We have to set an example and inspire each other!

<strong>4. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger musicians?</strong>

I wish I would of focused more on this project sooner. I wanted to play and do so many things at same time that sometimes my vision of where I wanted this project to go was blurred at times. I also wished I would of had more confidence as a woman. As a professional musician, I wish I would of known them all I know about music business now.

<strong>5. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.</strong>

I didn't listen to much music but once I started paying attention to music on Spotify, Pandora, etc and making my playlists, it really motivated me to write and arrange more music. Also seeing how you can change someone's life through music or even connect with someone who doesn't speak your language, is what keeps me motivated to do what we do.

<img class="wp-image-2083 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0345-2.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="257" height="386" />

 	<li><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">    </span><b>PREVENT strain through awareness of posture and alignment:</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">The key here is </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">being aware</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> of our posture, especially in tense situations where our mental stress can translate into tight muscles and lead to strain and overall inefficiency. We want to use our body in maximum efficiency mode, letting our skeleton do the work of holding our body upright and therefore allowing our muscles to do their work unhindered. Here is a quick checklist:</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">o</span><span style="font-weight:400;">   </span><b>Weight Distribution</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: Where do you feel your weight supported in the chair? You should feel your two “sitz bones” directly under each hip where your thighbone meets your hip joint. If you have trouble finding them see this helpful video:</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAbujEhLrY"> <span style="font-weight:400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAbujEhLrY</span></a>

<span style="font-weight:400;">----&gt; Note: If you are standing to play, you won’t be balancing on your sitz bones, you will be balancing on the “four corners” of your feet (the heel and ball of both feet) with your feet hip width apart, keeping awareness of where your thigh bone connects into your hip joint, keeping your </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">knees unlocked </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">and the same awareness of a flat back, floating head, neutral chin</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">Thank you to Lindsay of “Thousand Petal Lotus Living” for this excellent graphic showing the pitfalls of standing and proper alignment:</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2084" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-23-at-11-44-47-am.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="205" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">o</span><span style="font-weight:400;">   </span><b>Head</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: Your skull “floats” on a ball and socket joint. Slowly and gently trace an infinity sign with your chin. Can you feel a length in your neck and free and easy movement through the whole movement? If not, take a pause at the spots where you feel tension and breathe in and out through your nose for a few breaths as you release the tension in those spaces.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">o</span><span style="font-weight:400;">   </span><b>Chin</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: Are you bringing the instrument to you or jutting your chin toward the instrument? Is your chin in a neutral position or aimed down at the floor or up toward the ceiling? (It should be neutral)</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">o</span><span style="font-weight:400;">   </span><b>Shoulders</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: Bring your shoulders up to your ears, roll them back to squeeze your shoulder blades together and then bring them down away from your ears. Do this a few times until you can feel the weight of your arms hanging from your shoulder joints and a length across your body from the top of one shoulder to the other. </span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-2085" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/avoid-arching-your-back-2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="228" height="228" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-2087" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/avoid-arching-your-back.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="207" height="207" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-2088" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/avoid-arching-your-back-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="198" height="198" />

<ol start="2">
 	<li><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">    </span><b>Shoulder stretch and neck release with Chair</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This simple stretch can be done any time during practice or a rehearsal break. Simply stand behind a sturdy chair and place your elbows on the back of the chair. You can rest your forehead on the back of the chair between your elbows or, if you are open enough, you can let your head drop between your elbows as you see Rebecca doing in the photo. Be sure to walk your feet out and away from the chair so you ankles are directly under your hips to give you a flat back (no sway back or arched back).  Hold for several minutes, breathing deeply and out through your nose, making sure you don’t lock your knees.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2089" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0844.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" />

https://youtu.be/xzlWQcqLTLE
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">    </span><b>Eagle Arms</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Many of you have probably come across this one before, but I had to add it into the mix because it works so well! Standing or sitting, bring your arms out to the side so you are in a T shape and then bring your elbows together in front of your body, crossing your right elbow over your left elbow. If it is available to you, bring your left fingertips to meet your right palm so your arms are twisted around each other in a spiral. You should feel a stretch across the back of your shoulders. Be gentle! If you want a deeper stretch you can pull your elbows down and/or out away from your body. ** Do this on the other side by releasing your arms and crossing left elbow over right elbow.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2090" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0846.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" />      <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2091" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0847.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" />

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">    </span><b>Rag Doll</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This is a simple forward fold, folding forward from the hip joint, staying balanced on the four corners of your feet.  </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Bend your knees as needed</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to feel the lengthening of your spine. The neck and shoulder release is created by adding downward weight when you clasp your elbows or, (if available to you), placing your palms under your feet. Hold this for at least a minute, longer if possible, concentrate on breathing in and out through the nose, and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">come up slowly </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">when you are ready to release.</span>

<ol start="5">
 	<li><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">    </span><b>Wall Twist</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight:400;">This twist is less intense than what you might do during a yoga practice because you should be properly warmed up before you jump into a really deep twist. Keep that in mind as you do this at the wall! Place your chair about 1-2 feet from the wall and stand beside the chair, between the chair and the wall. Place your right foot on the chair. Keeping your right knee above your ankle, turn your torso to face the wall and reach your left arm straight out along the wall. You can reach your right arm up or straight out in line with your left arm. Repeat twist on the other side, placing your left foot on the chair.  </span>

		<title>Five Things I Learned While Making My First Album</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright - I've been saving this post for a little while but now it is officially time since my album came out this week on Tuesday November 7th. Throughout the whole process of making my album, I have learned<strong> so much </strong>while making "As I Am" and a lot of people have asked me great questions about  the process so I thought it would be great to organize my thoughts into a blog post.

First: for those of you that don't know me too well: here is a super quick background :) A little over a year ago, I wanted to pick some rep for a recital and found a couple great pieces by women composers. Rather than doing another recital, I knew that I would be graduating with my Masters in May and I thought that an album featuring music by women composers would be a great thing to graduate with.... so here we are! I commissioned about half of the composers featured on the album and found the rest of the pieces on my own. I also crowdfunded about 80% of the costs for the album which was unbelievably helpful. The album would not have been possible without those contributions so if you were one of the 150+ people who helped make the album possible, thank you so much!!

<a href="http://www.kateamrine.com/shop/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2160" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/album-cover.jpg?w=1024" alt="album cover" width="570" height="517" /></a>
Here's a formal description:

<em>As I Am </em>is my debut album featuring new music for trumpet by women composers. This album includes a wide range of contemporary trumpet playing, from lyrical melodic lines to improvisation to extended techniques. The album includes music for solo trumpet, flugelhorn, trumpet with electronics, trumpet and piano, trumpet + electronics + harp, and flute + violin. <em>As I Am </em>presents music by Alexandra Gardner, Ariel Marx. Jennifer Higdon, Jessica Rudman, Jinhee Han, Ledah Finck, Nicole Piunno, and Kate Amrine. <!--more-->

<hr />

<strong>1. Assemble a team.</strong>

I was very fortunate throughout the process of making my album to have people to turn to for questions and feedback. I often consulted friends for their opinions on everything from fundraising to what the cover should look like. One of my friends was also making an album at the same time and it was so helpful to go back and forth, figuring things out together (thanks Eunbi !!). I also was in touch with my teachers Ray Mase, John Rojak, and other musicians who have made albums. While some people have one person act as a producer for their albums - which can be extremely helpful in maintaining a consistent artistic vision - I chose to be my own producer for each recording session and throughout the editing process. However, I arranged for a different friend to attend each recording session so there was always someone other than me, the musicians, composer, and the engineer listening and commenting. After I was done recording, editing, mixing and mastering - I also worked with a coach to help me get organized prior to the release date. This was a huge relief to be in contact with someone who has the experience of managing many past CD releases and knew the ins and outs.

Side note -- Ultimately, if it is your project, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span> will always be the most invested and have to make the final decisions. Sometimes too many opinions can get confusing and be overwhelming - so remember to always keep your intentions in check.

<strong>2. Pick music you love.</strong>

When I started researching what it was like recording an album and how people pick what to play, this comment always stood out to me. Part of me thought, "wow why would anyone go through the entire process of making a CD if they don't choose music they truly love??" But just like how people pick the same standard repertoire for their final recital in school, I think the same thing can happen when making an album. There are so many recordings of standard concertos and sonatas out there already - maybe you are truly in love with one of those pieces and want to document your original spin on it -- if so then good for you! But for the rest of us - please don't think for a minute that you should record a piece because it is a <em>typical piece for your instrument </em>or it is <em>what people play </em>or even <em>what people like. </em>While you do have to consider what would sell or interest the public musically, this album or project is YOURS and YOURS ONLY. You will be the one practicing the music, listening to the edits, assisting with the mixing/mastering process, and performing the music - so be sure to pick pieces that you truly love working on and listening to over and over again.

I was very blessed with the music I selected. I was so focused on creating the best possible product and honoring the intentions of the piece and the composer - that it rarely felt like a struggle to keep moving towards the final version.

<strong>3. Figure out what you don't know.</strong>

Technical stuff like navigating Protools, copyright laws, performance rights organizations, how to print CDs, and other things along those lines are TOTALLY not my favorite. I said recently that the easiest part of making an album will be practicing and recording the music. It is totally true. I have learned so many technical things throughout this process that I didn't realize or think of ahead of time that it is almost impossible to list all of them here.

Regardless of whether you are making an album or starting a new project, figure out what you don't know! Talk to people who have done it before and find some of the best DIY resources out there and get started!

<strong>4</strong><strong>. Be Flexible and prepared for things to go wrong - because they will !</strong>

This one was definitely the hardest for me. Since I was acting as my own producer throughout the process, I had to adapt to a huge volume of decisions. Just when you think you have crossed all of the T's and dotted the i's something else will come up - so it is important to triple triple quadruple check everything!

I definitely made mistakes and wish that I could change some things. Rather than go through all of those individually :) I'll just pick a select few.
<ul>
	<li>Allow for a ridiculous amount of time in the studio - You have to account for things like setting up, how your face / body feels, transportation issues, technology issues, and pretty much anything you can think of! Recording is very tiring and it is harder to focus on performing well if you are worried about running out of time in the studio!</li>
	<li>Everything takes longer than you think it will. From graphic design stuff, to printing the physical CDs or mixing/mastering. Allow extra time for everything!!</li>
	<li>Have someone or multiple people check something before you officially click GO on anything permanent.  Printing CDs, emailing blasts of people, and finalizing an edit on a track are examples of things that can be very expensive, impossible, and potentially embarrassing to have to fix so try and avoid it if you can!</li>
</ul>
Focusing on these issues leads me to my last point and perhaps the most important...

<strong>5. Have fun, relax, remember the why!</strong>

It is impossible to have everything be perfect. Wondering "what if" and focusing on how you could have done things differently takes you away from the current moment and your future projects. All we can control is how we react to things in the moment and our actions in the future.

At the end of the day, I had so much fun being able to work on and record the incredible music on my CD. Watching the project come together over a year was such an unbelievably enjoyable process and it feels so great to finally be able to share the music with everyone.

<p class="font_8">Next to music, reading and books have been a great passion of mine, and I've been a serious reader my whole life. They provided a huge escape for me while I was growing up. My favorite writers are Haruki Murakami, Junot Diaz, Banana Yoshimoto, Julia Alvarez, Wally Lamb, and Margaret Atwood. Stories and books have the ability to expand our humanity and raise our consciousness. I also read a ton of business and music business books, and I've listed below some of my favorites (not in any order).</p>

<p class="font_8">This is the ultimate guide, almost like a reference book, for all musicians. I still go through it all the time to check certain things, such as how to format a CV, a list of tax-deductible expenses, etc. I also really like how Angela incorporates real stories and examples to illustrate her points on ways musicians can create their own opportunities through having an entrepreneurial mindset. Many musicians balk at investing in themselves (even though they probably paid an arm and a leg to go to conservatory) but did you know <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/arts/music/ices-founder-claire-chase-will-relinquish-leadership-role.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire Chase</a>, founder of ICE and MacArthur Fellow started with a budget of $600 from her holiday catering job tips?</p>

I've given this book to friends as gifts multiple times. It has a wonky title but the book outlines extremely effective communication techniques. The ability to communicate effectively is key in getting what we want whether it's for a job interview, request for a raise or promotion, negotiating fees, or asking a presenter to book you. One major takeaway I got from this book  is to always frame asks in the other person's self-interest.

<strong>Originally from Long Island, NY, Alaina began playing the trombone at the age of nine, but shortly after beginning switched to Euphonium.  When she turned twelve she picked up trombone again and began pursing both instruments.  In 2002 she was accepted  to the University of Michigan as a double major in trombone and euphonium performance where she studied with David Jackson and Fritz Kaenzig.  Alaina received her Masters in trombone performance from the Manhattan School of Music in 2010 and studied with Stephen Norrell.</strong>

<strong>1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do. What group are you in? </strong>

<!--more-->

I am a trombonist with the West Point Band. I primarily play in a wind band, brass quintet and marching band. I also continue to freelance around NYC and am a member of the quintet Collective Brass.

<strong>2. What do you love about being a musician in the military? What about being a female brass player?</strong>

I love that my job is never dull and everyday brings something different.  Here are just a handful of examples of the kinds of things that could happen in any given week... Concerts for the surrounding communities, ceremonies for presidents and dignitaries, football halftime shows, various televised events, funerals, military ceremonies, parades, collaborative concerts with Juilliard, masterclasses at local schools, recording projects,  playing for a cartwheel world record setting event...yes, they get pretty ridiculous sometimes!

As for being a female brass player, I am proud to be a part of a community that is pushing boundaries and helping in our way to prove that women are just as capable as men in every facet of life.

<strong>3. Having a stable and rewarding job playing for a living is something many of us strive for. Have your goals changed since you joined the group? Any future plans or projects you are a part of in addition to the group?</strong>

Yes my goals have changed a bit.  The goals I set now are put in place to ensure that I keep growing and improving as a musician.  Having a steady job is great, but in my particular job, there can be periods where the playing we are doing is not particularly challenging. I strive to challenge myself through my personal practice, outside projects, and just being sure that I am trying to play my best even if I am playing Stars and Stripes for the millionth time that week.

I do have some projects and groups that I am working with outside of West Point. I will be a guest artist this spring at East Tennessee State University as a part of their Low Brass Festival.  I also just finished a recording project with the quintet I am a part of, Collective Brass, and we will be giving some recitals this winter and spring.

Besides that I am always eager to play with other groups when those opportunities present themselves.

<strong>4. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

Yes, absolutely. I wish I had realized that there would never again be a time in your life when you could dedicate as much time and energy to practicing, playing and studying all things music!  I would have taken advantage of that time even more than I did.  I think things only get more complicated once we are out in the real world, and all of those hours in your day will have to be allocated to so many different things.  The reality is that for most of us, we will graduate without a steady job, and will likely be juggling a day job, practicing and gigging, being our own manager and promoter etc.  So really enjoy that time in your life where you can just completely immerse yourself in music.

My advice for younger female musicians would be to not focus on the fact that you are female. My focus was always on playing my best and not letting my gender be any sort of a handicap. Sometimes it will seem like being a woman is putting you at a disadvantage, and other times it may actually seem like it gives you a leg up.  Focus on your musicianship...it doesn’t matter what gender you identify with.  Don’t give those people who judge a book by it’s cover the time of day.

<strong>5. Any resources you recommend? For example, are there any books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life, etc?</strong>

For me the resources I have turned to have been teachers, colleagues and friends. I have been surrounded by amazingly talented musicians my whole life and they have been the biggest influences on me.  They have been the biggest source of knowledge and inspiration. Take time to talk to all these people in your life, ask them for advice,  listen to them play, go to their shows, play with them!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Kate originally met Adrienne on a gig in the DC area and it was so great to hear from her in this interview. Adrienne has been doing great things in the DMV area and we are so excited to feature her here with the Brass Chicks community. </em>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-2238 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/adoctor.jpg" alt="ADoctor" width="298" height="417" />

<strong>Adrienne Doctor is a trumpet player residing in the Washington DC area where she is a member of a premier military band. An active freelance musician and teacher, she has performed with Monarch Brass, the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra, Dayton Philharmonic, the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, the Richmond IN Symphony Orchestra, the Kentucky Symphony Orchestra, and the Ars Nova Chamber Orchestra. She has given masterclasses at Duquesne University, Columbus State University, the University of Maryland, and various high schools around the country. Doctor has performed as a soloist at the Music For All National Summer Symposium, with the Seven Hills Sinfonietta, and the Ars Nova Chamber Orchestra. She attended the Pierre Monteux School for Conductors and Orchestra Musicians in 2010 and 2011 and the Bar Harbor Brass Institute in 2013. Her primary teachers include Philip Collins, Alan Siebert, and Roger Sherman. She resides in northern Virginia with her husband and two cats.</strong>

<strong>1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do. What group are you in?</strong>

<!--more-->My name is Adrienne Doctor, and I am a trumpet player in a premier military band in the Washington DC area. I also have a private studio in Fairfax County, VA. I did my BM in music education and MM in trumpet performance at the University of Cincinnati where I studied with Phil Collins and Alan Siebert. My husband is a trumpet player in the US Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps.

<strong>2. What do you love about being a musician in the military? What about being a female brass player?</strong>

I feel a great deal of pride being a member of a military band. I feel that serving other people is my calling. Being a member of a military band has been the perfect fit for me, in that regard. On a daily basis, I get to serve others by providing musical support to citizens, service members, their families, and leaders of the US and other countries around the world. One of the most important parts of my job is honoring fallen service members in Arlington National Cemetery whether it is providing musical support in full honor and standard honor funerals or playing taps at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This aspect of my job is incredibly rewarding and humbling.

Being a female brass player certainly has its ups and downs. We are certainly a minority in military bands. I am only the fourth female trumpet player in my unit’s 95 year history. An important value in the military is selflessness, so I try not to think of myself as a female brass player, but, rather, a brass player who is there to do my job and serve my unit and the people. However, a significant part of our job as a musical organization is to reach all people. In that regard, it is really important to have a diverse band because it allows us to connect with and represent the entire population. Recently, my unit’s trumpet ensemble put on a recital in which I was the only female performing. After the concert, a few young girls immediately came up to me to talk and ask questions. It was certainly a moment of clarity. It reminded me of the importance of having female brass players in the band. Those girls saw someone up on stage who was like them which made them able to connect with the concert and music in a different way had it only been men. It is so important to empower the next generation and show them that women can do anything. Similarly, I enjoy playing taps at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and hearing young girls and boys whisper, “it’s a girl,” as I march by.

<strong>3. Having a stable and rewarding job playing for a living is something many of us strive for. Have your goals changed since you joined the group? Any future plans or projects you are a part of in addition to the group? Tell us about your work playing for veterans and on the organizing side of the Patriot Brass Ensemble.</strong>

My goals seem to be constantly changing. When I was an undergraduate, I had every intention of becoming a beginning band or junior high band director. When I was a masters student, my goal was to make a living as a performer. After that dream was realized and I joined the military, my goal has been to be the best soldier musician possible. I hope to contribute as much as possible to the important mission of the band. Currently, most of my personal goals are related to community outreach and service. I volunteer at a homeless shelter, for a hospice center, at various retirement homes, and for the Patriot Brass Ensemble, which is a non-profit organization geared toward providing live concerts to veterans in VA retirement facilities around the country. One of the best parts of being in a military band is having the flexibility and time to volunteer. I have been through many difficult times in my life and have had to rely on the generosity of others. However, even during the most difficult of days, it was always easy to remember how blessed I am and that no matter how bad it got, I knew that many others have it way worse. My personal challenges made me determined to make the lives of those who are struggling better. My mother spent the last few months of her life in a nursing facility where I lived with her as her caretaker. Any program or event that the facility put on would make her and my whole week. This coupled with my military service inspired me to get involved in the Patriot Brass Ensemble and become the vice president of the board of directors. There is not much better than bringing a smile to the face of a veteran in a nursing or retirement facility. I always have plans to perform recitals at retirement facilities in a solo or chamber setting. Also, I have dreams to start a music program for kids at the homeless shelter where I volunteer.

<strong>4. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

My best advice to music students is to live your life fully outside the practice room. Our life experiences shape who we are as musicians and the kind of music that we make. Music has the ability to tell stories and make people feel many different emotions. You can tell these stories and convey these emotions best if you have experienced these emotions yourself. Also, college students who aspire to be performers or educators should focus on building professional and friendly relationships with their peers. Perfect grades are not all that important. Get out there and perform as much as possible with and for your peers and mentors. Focus on learning for yourself and not for your GPA. I also wish that I had started taking auditions sooner. I took my first audition as a masters student. Everything worked out and I won a job while finishing my masters degree. However, I felt that I learned more about myself as a musician after I took my first audition, and it helped me become competitive at future auditions.

My best advice to female brass players is to not be too focused on being a minority. You just have to focus on being the best you can be. Generally, women have to be that much more professional and that much better a musician to be taken seriously. Encourage each other and be proud of yourself and all you’ve accomplished. Also, do yourself a favor and go to the International Women’s Brass Conference in 2019. I went to the conference for the first time in 2017, and I have never felt so comfortable and supported in a musical environment. It was an inspiring week that I will never forget.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are pleased to welcome trumpeter Katie Clark as this week's Five Things Friday guest writer!</em>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2246" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/katieclark.jpg?w=287" alt="KatieClark" width="287" height="300" />When I first set out on my trumpet travels this fall, I was asked if I would like to write a piece for “5 Things Friday” on Brass Chicks about what I’ve learned or discovered while curating my own education this year.

I’ve been blogging about my travels, trumpet, and being gluten free on my blog, Katie’s Trumpet Travels (<a href="https://katiestrumpettravels.wordpress.com/">katiestrumpettravels.wordpress.com</a>), so feel free to find out more about me and my story there!

I voluntarily withdrew from my doctoral studies at the University of British Columbia last spring to attend the University of Toronto’s Master of Teaching program. However, after attending Chosenvale: The Center for Advanced Musical Studies in June, I realized that I needed to make the trumpet my career; I love it. So I was unsatisfied with my doctoral program, no longer wished to attend teachers college, and was forced to come up with a plan. I’ve always said that studying abroad would be a dream come true, but I was hesitant to spend two to four years abroad as I am very comfortable living in Canada and wish to work there one day. For some reason, I did not see it as a road block to spend one year abroad. I guess when you’re determined to make something happen, it happens.

I then decided that I didn’t need a school. I had spent the past seven years in music schools and really just wanted to expand my trumpet technique and proficiency. I needed teachers. I then considered the many teachers that I’ve met throughout the past few years whom I’ve learned a lot from and drafted out a travel plan. In doing this, I was also lucky to stumble across the news of a conservatory needing an extra trumpet performer for a concert in March and found a base point for my European adventure. Considering I was not going to be a full time student, I had a lot of free time to schedule lessons and other classes across Europe during my time abroad. I was also very lucky to have a friend who was taking a gap year between her undergraduate and graduate degrees join me on this adventure because travelling with someone is a lot more fun than travelling alone.

Anyways, too much rambling! I am now five weeks into my seven weeks of trumpet travel in Europe, am a contract student at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Den Haag, and have learned many new things about trumpet, travel, and myself that I will attempt to organize into a clear list. Please note that these are the most valuable things that I have picked up while travelling and curating my own education and that they may be different for you! <!--more-->
<h4>1. Be fearless. (Or at least pretend to be)</h4>
I can’t speak for everyone, but at least in my experience, I have often been afraid of failure or hesitant to go play for a teacher if I feel as though I haven’t made significant improvement. I think I am only beginning to realize that this fear of failure has stood in my way in the past. If we can leave our fears at the door before a lesson or a practice session, we are already in a much better mindset for learning and developing as a musician. Investing in a trip such as mine, I find it much easier to put this fear aside as I truly want to gain everything that I can from my time and studies abroad. Of course, fear has not vanished altogether, but it is something to always check in on and assess to learn how it effects our learning process. I also like to live by Amy Cuddy’s motto, “Fake it ‘til you become it”, as discussed in her 2012 TED talk titled, Your body language may shape who you are. Through faking it, we are essentially pretending to be something that we are not and this is a great time to eliminate our irrational fears.
<h4>2. Be curious.</h4>
A year ago, I would not have believed that I would (or could) be participating in a Stockhausen Masters program. I believed that the music of Stockhausen was only ever played by people who devoted their lives to learning and performing the music of Stockhausen. My new found curiosity for new music has exposed me to a whole new world of trumpet performance and practice. For example, I have learned about split tones, double pedals, and even attempted free improvisations, all of which I never seriously explored before. Have I completely eliminated orchestral repertoire from my practice? No. By being curious and learning about other genres of music, I am simply allowing myself to expand as a musician to become more well-rounded and versatile. I am also at a stage where I haven’t fully decided what I want to do as a full-time career with trumpet, so it doesn’t hurt to explore my options.
<h4>3. Things will go wrong.</h4>
Planning a trip and micromanaging every detail is almost impossible and you must accept to take it day by day sometimes. Perhaps the train you’re on can’t take you to your destination and then you have to take six other trains to get to where you wish to go. These set-backs must be taken in stride otherwise you are in for a miserable day. Maybe you will have to sprint for your train. These things happen and are transferable to trumpet practice. You might think that you are on the right path to the destination, but then you get turned around and have to take six other paths to get to where you’re going. The sooner we accept this and learn to work around and through our problems, the sooner we get to our end goals. Of course, it is easy to feel sorry for ourselves, but I often find that any combination of food, a nap, or a cry, along with a deep breath can help set me straight again.
<h4>4. Journal, journal, journal.</h4>
Dear Diary...
Ok, it doesn’t have to be that formal, but definitely journal about everything. Food, cities, people, travel, trumpet lessons; everything! Having been on this trip for five weeks now, I have passed the point of feeling over-saturated and am thankful that I have recorded lessons, reflected on concepts that work, and have written about where I’ve traveled to remember every detail. I have enjoyed organizing my thoughts to truly understand what I am gaining from this experience and I feel this can be applied everywhere. Journal about your practice, about classes you attend, things that make you happy, things that make you mad. Begin to spend more time understanding who you are and what you want to be. I have even journaled about crazy dreams I have had while I’m here, and sketched pictures to go along with them.
<h4>5. Be in the moment.</h4>
For the first few weeks of the trip I found myself always looking forward to the next thing. We would be in The Hague and I would be excited for Berlin. Or we were in Berlin and I was excited for Florence. As much as I like to plan ahead and be ready for everything, I have had to force myself to live day-by-day and appreciate the moment that I am in. This idea is very applicable to my ideal practice session. How can I find flow and ease to practice or work for an entire day? I believe that I have to first find something I love doing and then apply myself and make the time. Of course, to avoid burning out, it is also important to do something other than trumpet and give ourselves some space from music, but that something must be done with purpose. If you are going to a museum, really ask yourself what it is you enjoy or dislike about the collection. If you are going on a run, don’t hold back. If you just need to watch some television and turn off your brain, don’t look at your phone and iPad at the same time. Whatever and wherever your moment is, just be in it.

I hope that you have found this interesting and applicable to your practice and that you begin to challenge yourself in new ways. Making the decision to leave my doctoral studies was not an easy decision, but it is one I had to make to explore where trumpet performance can take me. Ask yourself what your dreams are and then do everything that you can to help achieve those dreams. Also, keep in mind, that there are many people who are willing to help; teachers, friends, and family. It’s up to you to ask to ultimately pursue your dreams. Your path will not be the same as mine, but it is just as attainable! Best of luck wherever your studies may take you!

<strong>Staff Sergeant Tiffany Hoffer earned a Master of Music degree from the Manhattan School of Music and a Bachelor of Music degree from Indiana University. Prior to joining The U.S. Army Field Band in 2016, SSG Hoffer was an active freelancer in New York City, performing with various ensembles such as the Park Avenue Chamber Symphony, Richmond County Orchestra, and the Patriot Brass Ensemble. She has attended music festivals around the country, including Spoleto Festival USA, Aspen Music Festival, Chosen Vale International Trumpet Seminar, and the Rafael Mendez Brass Institute. She has also been a semi-finalist several times in the National Trumpet Competition’s high school, undergraduate, and graduate solo divisions. SSG Hoffer’s primary teachers include Vincent Penzarella, John Rommel, and her own father, Gil Hoffer.</strong>

<hr>

1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do. What group are you in? How long have you been in it? <!--more-->

My name is Tiffany Hoffer, and I play trumpet in the U.S. Army Field Band. We travel all over the country playing concerts, and our mission is to spread the Army’s message through music. I’ve been in the band for a little over a year.

2. What do you love about being a musician in the military? What about being a female brass player?

Personally, I absolutely love being a musician in the military. I enjoy playing a huge variety of music with some of the best musicians and most wonderful people I’ve ever known. I won’t take it for granted a day in my life.

3. Having a stable and rewarding job playing for a living is something many of us strive for. Have your goals changed since you joined the group? Any future plans or projects you are a part of in addition to the group?

It is absolutely different to be in the job than it is to still be auditioning. And yes, I’d say my goals have shifted. For so long, my one and only goal was to win a job, and I dedicated the majority of my time and financial resources toward that endeavor. Now that I’ve been lucky enough to reach that goal, I don’t really have one big goal any more, but tons of really small goals, both within and outside the organization.

4. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?

I think the most important thing I had to learn was how to stay focused on my craft, even in the face of judgment and/or negative treatment. As women, we tend to experience a slew of different issues in this traditionally male-dominated field. After repeated negative experiences, it’s only natural to become a little defensive, and to feel the need to prove ourselves to those who judge us. For me personally, that mindset hindered my progress. When I gave myself permission to ignore outside opinions and just focused on me and my own progress, I truly started to move in the direction I wanted. If you stay focused on yourself and continually improve your craft, you will prove yourself to others just by doing what you do. This isn’t necessarily a gender-specific idea, but given what we experience as women in this field, I think it’s especially important to keep this in mind.

5. Do you have any suggestions for fellow Brass Chicks interested in a career in a military band or an orchestra who are going on the audition path?

Record yourself. A lot. And not just for the audition tapes. Record your practice and listen back. If you can, record your auditions and listen back. The recorder never lies, and listening back to your own playing gives you a very accurate picture of everything that’s going on. Not only will you figure out exactly what needs work, you’ll also hear the things that are going well, and that can be a great confidence boost.

Listen to great musicians! Any time you are preparing something for an audition, listen to multiple professional recordings of it, and use those recordings as a reference for style, tempo, phrasing, etc.

A couple other things...this sort of echoes what I said before, but, stay focused on your own progress. Try not to pressure yourself to go out and win a job tomorrow. Go to the auditions, give 110% every time, and keep track of your improvement. If you’re improving each time, you’re going in the right direction.

And if you’re going in the right direction, let yourself celebrate that. It can be very easy to get discouraged. Rather than thinking of each experience that doesn’t result in gainful employment as a failure, think of it as a learning experience. Take what you can from it to make the next time better. And if you DO make next time better, that’s a success. Let yourself feel good about that.]]></content:encoded>

	<li><b>Defining success</b></li>
</ol>
Being in music school you are taught all of the tools needed to successfully become a musician.

We receive amazing master classes, one on one instruction with our professors, great guest lecturers and much more. All of these amazing opportunities give us the tools we need to succeed in the field, whether you become a performer, teacher, administrator or even entrepreneur. When I completed my music studies by receiving a bachelor, masters and two performers certificates, I felt more then ready to enter the field, take auditions, network, free lance, teach and be the go getter I needed to be. My first year after my masters, I was officially #adulting, aka, financially solo. I picked up a part time job waitressing to make money, but I got so obsessed with having money so I wouldn’t stress with finances that I turned down last minute gigs or turned away auditions that were far away because I didn’t want to take off of work at the last minute and risk losing a somewhat flexible job that I had because trust me it is rare to find for a musician. A year into the job, I was starting to feel angry because my soul was not satisfied. I was practicing less, and feeling really grouchy about it and on top of it I was feeling like a loser because every where I turned, all of my fellow classmates were winning jobs and I had the few gigs and students but mainly was a waitress. Well fast forward a few years and I am now making a big chunk of my income from teaching and performing and no longer waitressing! To me, that is a level of success, because I am not relying on waitressing to pay my bills. I can officially call myself a free lance musician. So then why is it when I returned to one of my alma matters and was discussing with a professor about my recent achievements that they said, just wait and your time will come. In my head, I was thinking, my time will come? How is this not successful? So it is only success when we can say we are a title with a name? Well let me tell you, I jumped through hurdles to get to this personal level of success, and I feel so good about it! So please, if anyone tries to tell you other wise, stick to what is an achievement for yourself and just like with any goal, once you reach it, you never stop, you keep reaching and that is what I am doing. I hit a level of success of not needing to waitress and now my next level is to win a job and then after that become a full time horn professor. If you are making money playing your instrument, you have succeeded.

<b>        2. Practicing less is more
</b><b>
</b>My first year out of school I faced two challenges. The first challenge was finding the time to practice and the second challenge was finding a place to practice. I lived in an apartment and I would practice there until someone complained and I had to stop. I really do not like playing with a silent mute all the time so I would crash the practice rooms of a local music school. But it was taking a risk, because sometimes I would find a room and other times they would be full during the ninety minutes that I had to practice. I also kept getting tired of lugging all of my stuff back and forth so I decided to post on a local moms face book group asking for private studio space to rent and I got lucky because I found a woman that rented me this amazing space in the woods and instead of paying her, I got to do social media for her private furniture company. So the challenge of finding a space was solved, but what about time? Mama mia, where is there time? In my undergrad every guest speaker would say the same thing, “Practice now while you are in school because you will not have the time when you leave”, and in my head I would say “yeah right, I will never have that issue because I am so diligent with my time management and squeezing in two to three hours of practicing.” Well dang, I hate admitting it but they were right. Between gigs, teaching, part time job, and making sure I sleep, the day slips by and the time I used to have to practice no longer exists, unless I make it work. I try my best to wake up early before work to get a warm up in, and on days that are crazy, I try to find an hour to practice to make the most out of that precious time. This has led to becoming  more efficient and focused in my practicing.  I actually have improved more in the first year out of school then I did when I actually was in school. When I am driving to work, I play the excerpts that I am learning for an audition or listen back to recordings of my practice sessions. While I am at work, I sing rhythms and excerpts to repertoire I am learning, so that when I enter the practice room, my mental training is done and all I need to do is apply it to the horn. No matter how tired I am or how much is going on I try to at least schedule an hour a day to the horn so that I feel accomplished and more confident that I am not slacking.

&nbsp;

	<li><b> Having another job is okay</b></li>
</ol>
I’m now experienced with many jobs. I have waitressed, catered, sold wine, did arts administration, babysitting, web sales, shipping and inventory, youth group leader, pretty much if it was money and fit into my schedule I would do it. Thus the feeling of shame crept in as I was having to do another job that was not music.  Come to find out, after discussing this topic with colleagues, I learned that I was not alone and had nothing to be ashamed of. I then thought that this would make a great poll question for my social media network. I, therefore, reached out to all of my friends on Facebook and to my surprise, people who hold famously delicious playing jobs, whom I never thought of responding, did! The jobs they mentioned having were; office services representative, arts administrator, amazon warehouse associate, substitute teacher, bartender, server, tutoring, dog walking, personal trainer, babysitting, real estate, customer service, coffee barista, box office, among many others. Like I said, when people were writing in, people whom I know of that play Broadway shows, have a full time free lance scene or a full time playing job, were surprising me with other day jobs that they also have. This is the reality that is not taught to us in school. There is no reason to feel ashamed that you are collecting money from another source and if anything I used the extra jobs that I did as another form of networking. I would always carry my business card with me because you never know who you would meet. One night when I was waitressing, I met a couple that was the director of the culinary institute, and he got me a gig there as background music for a French champagne event. I got paid, fed and was served expensive French champagne, life was good!  I would view my “other job” as another form of networking and thinking of it as an investment of meeting different people that I would never meet to open my horizons to different opportunities for performing.  Now that I am freelancing for a good majority of the time, whenever there is a slow month I call back my old jobs asking if they need an extra hand so that I can make a few extra bucks during the slow times.

&nbsp;

<b>        4. Age is nothing but a number  </b>

I started to have a career in freelancing at the age of 24. I thought I was old for my age in the field because everyone I went to school with was winning a job. Though as I started to talk around to the fellow musicians in the groups I was playing with, I was practically the baby! While studying with Javier Gandara, we talked about this exact topic. He told me that for the the majority, people don’t win their big job until their late thirties, early forties.  And sure enough everyone I was gigging with were in their thirties or older. He told me that it was not until his late twenties that he really understood how to play the horn and I feel like I can relate to that. I feel like my mental maturity has allowed me to understand concepts of my playing that were lacking, to finally improve them! There is not a lot to say on this exact topic other than to not compare yourself to others. We are constantly hearing about these successful young players winning big jobs and it can make us feel like that is the big picture, but the reality is that it is not. It reminds me to keep my mind on my goal and focus on my growth.  Whether you make it at twenty or forty, there is no difference because you are making it!

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li><b> You are not alone</b></li>
</ol>
The more I speak about this with other collegues the more I feel that these topics are important. It is important to know that you are not alone. Do not allow the level of success of everyone around you effect you to becoming the best you can. Whether you continue in performance, or move on to another field, never think that you have failed. Just the other day I asked my friends on Facebook another poll question and it was “if you primarily are financial on freelancing, how long did it take you to get to that point”. Their response? For the most part, it has taken people anywhere from one to six years to get started nationally and internationally. Each individual explained that there is never a moment that passes by of not feeling financially secure but just keep doing what you can, going day by day and take pride in the moments that are strong and find the strength inside you to get through the moments of weakness. As people always say they wish their high schools had prepped them for life skills such as filing taxes, I wish the conservatories I attended had discussed the real balance between succeeding in the field while balancing life.  Always support your friends, your colleagues and most importantly support yourself!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Books to Revamp Your Mindset and Motivate You on the Path to Success</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="auto">

As a teacher and a performer, I love reading books about performance psychology and business. Anything that challenges me to reevaluate ways I've been thinking and design smarter habits is great for both me and my students. I've been thinking for a while about which books I would choose for this post and it was actually been pretty difficult since there are so many great options. I decided to limit my choices to books that are not specifically about music but are still extremely relevant to musicians. <!--more-->

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2294" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5708.jpg?w=1024" alt="5TF Books" width="582" height="336" />

<b>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/"><em>It's </em></a></b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377/"><em><strong>N</strong><b>ot </b><strong>H</strong><b>ow </b><strong>G</strong><b>ood </b><strong>Y</strong><b>ou </b><strong>A</strong><b>re, </b><strong>It</strong><b>'s </b><strong>H</strong><b>ow </b><strong>Good</strong><b> </b><strong>You</strong><b> </b><strong>Want</strong><b> </b><strong>To</strong><b> </b></em><strong><em>Be,</em></strong><b> by Paul Arden </b></a>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2289" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/41pkjkb6bl-_sx337_bo1204203200_.jpg?w=204" alt="41PKj+kB6BL._SX337_BO1,204,203,200_" width="204" height="300" />I have been reading this book for years since my parents gave it to me in high school and it is a great book for any creative person with goals in mind. We have all heard the story about the tortoise and the hare – about how persistent hard work will always prevail far beyond raw talent – but it is true!

One of the parts I enjoyed most about this book was its easy to read format; some pages even only had one sentence! Large print and easy legibility make the potentially intimidating ideas this book addresses approachable. The book starts out with these three sentences: "Nearly all rich and powerful people are not notably talented, educated, charming or good - looking. They become rich and powerful by wanting to be rich and powerful. Your vision of where you want to be is the greatest asset you have."

<b>2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366318&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+a+badass"><em>You are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</em>, by Jen Sincero</a></b>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2291" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/51ypp1c97l-_sx315_bo1204203200_.jpg?w=191" alt="51ypp1C+97L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_" width="191" height="300" />This was one of the first books I read after finishing my Masters degree and, wow, was it helpful!!

Being in music school is a very self-critical experience that can be very overwhelming, even if it is always focused on positive improvement and support. It is so easy to compare ourselves to our mentors and other people around us that may have entirely different personal circumstances and situations. Remember, especially on social media, we only see the everyone's highlight reel of all of the best things happening. I really liked how this book helped me change my thinking and was exactly the motivation I needed to read after finishing school. Sincero includes actionable steps in each chapter to reevaluate your beliefs and your actions – and she helps you refocus them. This book is great for throwing perceptions back in your face, helping you to face your strengths and work to improve your weaknesses.  Here's a great quote: "Our entire experience on this planet is determined by how we choose to perceive our reality."

3. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366368&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mindset+carol+dweck"><em>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</em>, by Carol Dweck</a></strong>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2290" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/51fexyx8wql-_sx322_bo1204203200_.jpg?w=195" alt="51FexyX8WQL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_" width="195" height="300" />This book is so great for teachers and students or anyone that is actively involved in learning. This book identifies the fixed mindset and the closed mindset. The <em>fixed mindset</em> is believing that your qualities are carved in stone – leading to urgently needing to prove yourself over and over. The <em>growth mindset </em>is believing that your basic qualities are things that you can change on your own over time. These different outlooks translate directly into your daily actions and reactions to situations. For those of us who teach, these ideas can frame how we interact with students and how our students and children interact with each other.

For example, what if you are an orchestral trombone player and you get called for a gig you usually play, but one of the pieces has a big featured jazz solo in it? As an orchestral player, jazz may not be your strong suit. So, if you have a <em>fixed mindset, </em>you may believe that this is a situation that will expose your lack of talent and end up labeling you as a failure because you couldn't possibly improve in that area. You simply are not that kind of musician. If you have a <em>growth mindset, </em>however<em>, </em>then you will react to the situation with motivation, confronting the problem, and believing that your efforts will make a difference in your playing. Of course, we are not all black and white with one mindset 100% of the time. There are almost always things about ourselves that we can feel strongly that we can't change. And yet, with hard work and awareness of your mindset, anything is possible.

4. <strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feminist-Fight-Club-Survival-Workplace/dp/0062689037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366562&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=feminist+fight+club">Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Manual</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feminist-Fight-Club-Survival-Workplace/dp/0062689037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366562&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=feminist+fight+club"> (</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feminist-Fight-Club-Survival-Workplace/dp/0062689037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366562&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=feminist+fight+club"><em>for a Sexist Workplace)</em>, by Jessica Bennett</a></strong>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2292" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/513dd03hr7l-_sx373_bo1204203200_.jpg?w=225" alt="513dD03hR7L._SX373_BO1,204,203,200_" width="225" height="300" />Although this book is written for women in a typical business office structure, the way Bennett describes the difficulties women face in those situations feels all too familiar and relevant for musicians. <em>Feminist Fight Club</em> was a very quick read with a conversational tone and fun illustrations in the margins. This amusing style helps hammer some of the points home and makes a book that is primarily directed at people in business in a typical office environment much more relevant and applicable to freelance musicians.

For those who might worry that this book is just a complaining manifesto against men: don't worry! The book is full of statistics, references from actual studies, quotes, and interviews that Bennett uses to back up her points. She outlines the problems that women face in the workforce by describing characters like the "Mansplainer" who condescendingly explains things to women who usually already know what the answer is. I am sure we have all experienced this. After illustrating each of these characters, Bennett describes ways to fight back and counter the behavior. She also includes problematic behavior that women sometimes display that unknowingly makes these stereotypes worse like the "Credit Defaulter" who upon receiving a compliment about a job well done will immediately respond, "Oh thank you, but I couldn't have possibly done it without xyz" or will attribute recent success to luck or something else. Sound familiar? Of course it is important to be modest, but in a world where men are quick to point to their own innate qualities and skills it is important to take personal credit when deserved and value your own contributions!

5. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513366624&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+slight+edge"><em>The Slight Edge</em>, by Jeff Olson</a></strong>

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2293" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/41hc5pli3sl-_sx332_bo1204203200_.jpg?w=201" alt="41hC5Pli3SL._SX332_BO1,204,203,200_" width="201" height="300" />I recently finished this book and I have to say, it has become my new favorite. In a way, <em>The Slight Edge </em>combines many of the ideas from the four previous books all into one. This book is about evaluating your everyday actions, thoughts, and decisions, and realizing how that all figures into your greater success (or failure). Olson identifies the power of the "slight edge" – the awareness of those daily choices – and how it can affect and impact all areas of your life. Here's a great quote that summarizes many of the ideas he writes about: "Successful people do whatever it takes to get the job done, whether or not they feel like it." This book has helped countless people, including myself, become happier and more productive, so check it out!

We hope that everyone has a happy holiday season and is gearing up for 2018 with excitement and motivation. Hopefully these books will help!

		<title>Five Things to Keep in Mind When You are Stressed and Busy</title>

Hi fellow brass chicks! We didn’t forget it is Friday and hope you didn’t either! It is such a busy time of year with the holidays, school, and gigs and we certainly know things can get a little crazy. Hopefully this post will help :)

<strong>1. Perspective. </strong>

This one may seem obvious but it is always important to keep in mind that the stressful things that we are worrying about may be "first world problems" that not everyone has the pleasure of experiencing. For example, after a busy day of teaching and  playing, I walked into a cafe and ordered a small salad. The woman behind the counter yawned and apologized and I said, "Oh don't worry, I am tired too." But then she asked if I get to sit down at my job, because she was tired after standing all day - and as a musician, most of the time we are sitting so I definitely didn't have anything to say back. <!--more--><strong>2. Be Grateful</strong>

This is very similar to keeping your perspective in mind when in the face of "first world problems" but more related to simply appreciating everything that you have. Do you have food, a place to live, family, friends, and something you are passionate about? That is a lot more than some people and certainly something to be grateful for.

<strong>3. Appreciate where you are and what you have done</strong>

Especially in stressful times, it can be easy to lose track of your own personal accomplishments and truly appreciate and recognize everything that you have done. We are getting increasingly closer to the end of 2017 and I'm sure there are some amazing things that have happened that you can be proud of. Make a list and look at it whenever you need an extra boost! This is even more helpful for times when you feel like you are treading water and not moving forward in ways that you may like.

<strong>4. Look forward to something in the future.</strong>

Many of my students just finished midterms and are now preparing for finals. Some of them have holiday concerts. I personally have many gigs coming up - many of which all seem to be on top of each other and can make maintaining a healthy sleep schedule difficult. One of my mentors recently told me to keep this in mind recently and it is super helpful as a motivating goal to get through a long day or a long rehearsal. And it can be anything from getting to sleep in tomorrow (yeah!), having ice cream at home after the gig, or planning a vacation next year. Always treat yo self and give yourself something to look forward to!

<strong>5. Self Care</strong>

It seems like we talk about this a lot here on the Brass Chicks but it is super important! Beyond the usual eating well and taking care of your body and mind, when you have a free moment – evaluate your schedule. Do you really need to take on that extra opportunity? Do you really have time to do that other project? Is your time better spent getting a head start on your work or going out with friends? Sometimes the answer might not what you think but make sure to always pay attention to what your body and mind need!

Do you have any other tips that we haven't mentioned? We would love to hear from you, either in the comments or on social media!]]></content:encoded>

Since moving to New York City three years ago, Caitlin has been playing consistently with a number of orchestras, churches, theater companies and opera companies. She has also recently joined The Brooklyn Conservatory working as a music teacher in several of their Public School music outreach programs. In addition to freelancing, Caitlin is the fifth and newest member of the “Deliciously Creepy Cabaret Sensation”, Orphan Jane. A locally famous music ensemble. In 2016, Orphan Jane released their second </strong><strong>album, “The Traveling Everything Show”, on which Caitlin is featured. When she isn’t playing trumpet, Caitlin is a professional Dog Sitter in the NYC area as well as an aspiring Sommelier. Caitlin is a graduate of the Oberlin Conservatory where she studied under Roy Poper and received her Bachelor's in Trumpet Performance and a Minor in Ethnomusicology.</strong>

This past March, I decided to make a crazy and seemingly stupid life change. I decided to quit my cushy day job of two years and dedicate myself to my trumpet career full time. This meant losing the stability of a weekly paycheck and my own personal office where I called the shots, and buckling down to finally take action and move my career in the right direction. However, it also meant finally having the freedom to take chances, having the time to take care of my mental and physical wellbeing, and actually feel like I was being proactive about something that gave me a purpose for being in New York! <!--more-->

Since getting back to the city in September after a long difficult summer upstate (story for another time) I have faced challenges and surprises around every corner. In such a short time, I have felt my outlook on this profession and my lifestyle change drastically. I have learned things about myself and the people I surround myself with that I never could have imagined. On that note, I would like to share 5 things that I have learned over the past few months as a (rookie) full time freelance musician in New York City.

1) Making your own schedule is hard!

When I was locked into my 10-6 work schedule, I pretty much knew what my days would look like. Work all day, hit the gym if there was time, and then head to my evening trumpet obligation. Upon attempting this new freelance musician lifestyle, I realized that I had a lot of free time, and it was glorious!! Sleeping in, staying in my pajamas for most of the day, catching up on all of the Netflix, and of course, having the time to practice trumpet. It wasn’t too long that I realized that I was being incredibly unproductive and not making the best use of my blessed free time. I knew I had to change my mindset and create a schedule that would allow me to make progress in my goals and feel good about everything that I had accomplished that day. It was not easy. Waking up at 8am knowing that I didn’t have to be anywhere until 7pm that evening was tough. Starting my daily practice routine by 9am was even harder. Getting my lazy butt to the gym every day was the hardest! It all seems fruitless and a waste of energy and focus. However over time, I realized that now that I was my own boss, my life was my business and I needed to make sure that everything was in check and things were getting done! Several months in, I’m still struggling with this daily schedule but now I know and understand why it’s necessary and is all the motivation I need.

2) It’s the little things that make the big difference.

Admittedly, this realization was brought into clarity by one of my new favorite books, The Slight Edge. The book focuses on explaining how the seemingly insignificant and mundane things that we do on a daily basis are what shape our success in the future. This may seem like an obvious concept but keeping it in mind and applying it to everything you do is truly enlightening. I have seen the effects of this concept in such a short amount of time and I look forward to continuing to apply this mindset to every aspect of my life.

3) Sleep and Exercise are blessings!!

Working a full time job and freelancing (mostly) full time doesn’t allow too much time for personal care. I.e. sleep and exercise. Two things that allow us to be the most alert and productive! Seems a bit ironic.... Since revamping my life, I have made sleep and exercise a priority, and let me tell you, worth it!!! Getting enough sleep and pumping out those 30 minutes on the elliptical every day have completely changed my mentality and outlook. I’m no longer in that sleep deprived fog, I no longer hold onto anger and frustration, I am able to look at situations with a more open mind and make clear confident decisions. Not to mention I’m dropping all those sad stressed out pounds!!! Lovely side effect!

4) Being ready for anything is so important!

When life is moving slowly and there isn’t much going on, it’s easy to get behind and slack off. I have learned this lesson the hard way over and over again. Not being constantly on my toes has caused me a ridiculous amount of stress and anxiety and I’ve realized that I am always on call. I need to have my ducks in a row and be ready to play my best at any given moment. This is still something I struggle with but at least I’m figuring it out!

5) Every day is an adventure

The absolute best part of my new life is the ever changing excitement that I get to experience on a daily basis. I never expected each day to be so drastically different and surprising. Having a desk job, I knew exactly what to expect every single day and how it would make me feel. Now, even when repeating an activity such as playing the same show night after night, I can always expect the unexpected. As someone who is easily bored with mundane and repetitive things, this aspect keeps me alert and always guessing. I’m loving it!!!

Some (or even all) of these points may seem like obvious realizations, but honestly, they all caught me completely by surprise. Obviously exercise and sleep are important. Obviously you should always be prepared. But it’s not all obvious. Not until it becomes your reality. Looking forward to continuing to improve myself and learning many more “obvious” lessons!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This week we are very excited to present a Five Things Friday post by <b> <a href="https://www.joharrismusic.com/">Jo Harris</a>, member of the British trumpet quartet <a href="http://www.bellatromba.com">Bella Tromba.</a> </b></em>

<b>1. <a href="http://www.ceciliamcdowall.co.uk/">Cecilia McDowall</a> (b.1951)
</b>Cecilia wins hand down as the most prolific writer for brass soloists and chamber musicians. Expect lilting 6/8’s, flowing melodies and playable parts. Cecilia finds a personality in brass instruments that has all the joy of a dancing girl at a country fair.

Check out <a href="http://www.ceciliamcdowall.co.uk/scores/the-night-trumpeter"><i>The Night Trumpeter</i> for Trumpet and Piano</a> for stunning storytelling and extended techniques. <!--more-->

<b>2. <a href="https://ump.co.uk/composer/diana-burrell/">Diana Burrell </a>(b.1948)
</b>If grandeur is your thing then look no further than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04kdnvm">Diana’s awesome <i>Concerto for Brass</i> </a>and Orchestra premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 2016. She has also been commissioned by tenThing so in our minds she is a true Lady of Brass.

<b>3. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/0f51e5d1-25b1-423c-bf84-11b114a87682">Helen Perkin</a> (1909-1996)
</b>Oh brass bands, the last band stand of misogynistic man. (Whoops, did I say that?!) Unbelievably in the 164 years of the British Open Championships Helen Perkin is the only women to have composed an all-important contest piece, twice. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GAk3rtS_z8"><i>Carniva</i>l</a> and <i>Island Heritage</i> remain worthy of more outings and if you are lucky enough to play in a brass band then please suggest including Helen Perkin to the band master! She deserves far more credit.

<b>4. <a href="http://www.roxannapanufnik.com/">Roxanna Panufnik</a> (b.1968)
</b>I’ve found playing Roxanna’s orchestral parts and fanfares really enjoyable. I am yet to play her quintet or dectet but I bet they are great. It’s always a joy to have something put in front of you that is both flashy and playable…

Check out some of her chamber music <a href="http://www.roxannapanufnik.com/works-chamber.asp">here</a>.

<b>5. Joy Webb (b.1932)
</b>I remember the legendary James Watson playing <i>Share my Yolk</i> to the trumpet class at the Royal Academy of Music. I caught my friend (quartet member) Vickie’s eye and we were both tearing up! What a tune and what lyrics!
Joy Webb captured the essence of Christian humility and wrapped it up as popular ballads. On a Starry Night, The Candle of the Lord and Share My Yolk are melodies that every brass player should know.

Hear <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76TxtmEI6lg">Bella Tromba play Joy's beautiful piece "Share my Yolk"</a>

Winners of the Park Lane Group Young Artist Award, Bella Tromba have been active in the performance of new works since their formation at London’s Royal Academy of Music in 2004. Commissioned composers include  Paul Max Edlin (Southbank Centre), Howard Skempton (Cheltenham Music Festival) and John Reeman (Dartington Festival).

Bella Tromba performed <i>Telos 135</i> for four trumpets and timpani by Peter Maxwell Davies in the presence of the composer at Canterbury Christ Church University and recorded Peter Longworth’s <i>Colori di Roma</i> following performances in Germany, Poland and Canada. In 2012 Bella Tromba created an illuminating live electronic dance set that fused Classical Mozart with beat led tracks and sub bass frequencies for the Beautiful Days Festival.

In 2017 the quartet will premiere new works by Peter Yarde Martin and Peter Longworth.

Bella Tromba are actively seeking to raise funds to commission new works for brass to ensure a legacy for future generations of brass players.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Interview with Trumpeter Nadje Noordhuis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2380" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nadje.jpg?w=300" alt="nadje" width="300" height="232" /></strong>

Combining cinema sweep, transportive emotion, and rich melodic grandeur, Australian-­born trumpeter/composer Nadje Noordhuis possesses one of the most unforgettably lyrical voices in modern music. Her deeply-­felt, clarion tone and evocative compositional gift meld classical rigor, jazz expression, and world music accents into a sound that is distinctively her own. Noordhuis was one of ten semi-­‐ﬁnalists in the 2007 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Trumpet Competition and was selected as a Carnegie Hall Young Artist to undertake a weeklong residency with trumpet great Dave Douglas in 2010. Recent engagements include a yearly week-­long run at New York's Village Vanguard with Rudy Royston's 303, performances with the Grammy-­winning Maria Schneider Orchestra, performances at jazz festivals in Europe, Canada and Brazil with Grammy-­nominated Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, and regular appearances with her group at the historic 55 Bar in Greenwich Village.

<strong>1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do.</strong>

I’m a trumpet player and composer, mainly in the jazz realm. <!--more-->A couple of times a year I’ll do classical/new music gigs and/or commissions. I play with the Maria Schneider Orchestra, Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society, the Anat Cohen Tentet, and lead my own bands including a jazz quintet and a duo with vibraphonist James Shipp. I’m working on a solo show that features trumpet and electronics. I teach trumpet and piano privately, am a teaching artist with the New York Pops Education program, and teach jazz trumpet students at the MSM Precollege Division. I spend a lot of my time scheduling and rescheduling, suffering through Crossfit, and being disappointed with my coffee making skills.

<strong>2. What do you love about being a female jazz musician? What do you not love as much?</strong>

Being a woman jazz musician has a whole set of challenges. That’s not to say that success, whatever that means to you personally, isn’t possible, it just means that it can be more of a struggle. When I moved to New York, it took me about four years to get a gig with a well known male bandleader. Up until that point, I was only hired by women bandleaders or played in all-women bands. It was totally bizarre. I knew that unfortunately being hired by a man would give me validation in the scene that “I could play”. The general assumption is that women jazz players aren’t as capable, which is infuriating. In order to have gigs, and thus improve as a musician, I would have to create my own opportunities, which is why I started my quintet in 2009. Being a woman in this industry forces you to hone your entrepreneurial skills, that’s for sure. It can be frustrating when playing a gig and then have to deal with questions that a man wouldn’t have to deal with. For example, just a couple of days ago I was playing with a brass quartet, organ, and choir. Both of the trumpet chairs were women. One of the male singers commented “Wow! You trumpets are, like, really good! Like, legitimately awesome! So, what do you do for a living?” I said, “Well this might surprise you, but…I’m a trumpet player”.

When I’m playing in a large ensemble, I want to blend in because I’m a section player and not the leader. It’s difficult not to stand out when you are the only woman or one of two playing in a band of seventeen men. I get this question a lot - what’s it like touring with a bunch of men? My answer is that there’s no issue. They are all great humans - funny, talented, and accepting of me as an equal. I don’t need kid gloves or special treatment. I want to be treated the same as everyone else, and that usually happens now, which is fantastic. But there’s always some silliness to deal with. A couple of times I’ve left the stage at a restaurant club, and since I would generally be wearing all black, a patron at the club will hand me their check, assuming that I’m a server. But it took a really long time to get to the point where I know I can deal with any sort of frustration, and carry on.

<strong>3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

Absolutely. Before I left Australia, I ran a series of jazz workshops for high school women, which was incredibly rewarding. But after I had been in New York for a year or two, and was really struggling, I thought to myself that I can’t possibly encourage another woman to pursue this career path. It has taken me a while to realize that I was making a decision that was not mine to make, and if someone is passionate about improvising and playing jazz, then I want to help them as much as I can. My most important job is to be visible. When young women musicians see another woman play, they get this wide-eyed look - you can almost see the penny drop in their head that things they thought weren’t possible for them are in fact within their reach. I love doing clinics at colleges where there are usually less than a handful of women students. There’s a competitiveness that exists, as if there can only be one great woman trumpeter or saxophonist, but it’s not true. There’s room for everyone. There’s room for everyone, people! Shout it out!

<strong>4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own or when teaching?</strong>

Musicians today need to wear many hats. They need to be able to play and improvise across multiple styles, have amazing reading skills, teach a variety of ages and abilities, arrange, compose, handle their scheduling, network, book gigs, and be a manager. It’s a juggling act. It’s rarely enough to be a great musician anymore. Being able to switch between roles is something that I’m still working on, to be honest. If one aspect of my career is doing well, another role is usually tanking. If I’m writing, then I’m not organizing logistics. If I’m emailing or on the computer all day, I’m not going to be preparing for a gig. It can be exhausting with the constant switching around, and trying to not only deal with what’s happening now or in the next week, but also plan projects for the next six months to a year ahead. But then I’ll play a gig with a prominent and incredibly talented bandleader, like Maria Schneider or Anat Cohen, or my band will play a new tune and they tell me how much they like it, and it is so meaningful and fulfilling that it all seems worth it.

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

Find what you love and do that. And be okay with that. For example, I really love playing ballads and playing flugelhorn, but I thought because I lived in New York that I should be really great at bebop. And it was frustrating to me to learn how to play in that style because I didn’t feel like that music belonged to me, and it felt so out of reach. It has taken a long time to build my confidence across a range of styles, but I have to approach it as “this is how Nadje plays bebop”, and not try to compare myself to Clifford Brown or Freddie Hubbard.

I would recommend young women musicians to form their own bands. Don’t wait for someone to hire you. Find your sound and go for it. Your peers are your people. Treat them well! Be on time! And if you are lucky, you will get to hire each other for a long time to come.

<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.</strong>

I love a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Free-Play-Improvisation-Life-Art/dp/0874776317">Free Play by Stephen Nachmanovitch</a>, which is about keeping the spirit of play alive in improvisation. About sixteen years ago, I read a book about women jazz instrumentalists called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madame-Jazz-Contemporary-Women-Instrumentalists/dp/0195106474">Madame Jazz: Contemporary Women Instrumentalists by Leslie Gourse</a>, which I found incredibly depressing at the time because the last chapter was all about how it’s close to impossible to maintain a family life while you are on the road. But the first trumpeter I read about was Laurie Frink, and when I saw her name on the list of teachers at Manhattan School of Music, I knew that she should be my teacher. So in a way, that book changed my life. I’d be in Australia teaching high school students had I not read it. I’m a member of the <a href="http://www.australiantrumpetguild.com/">Australian Trumpet Guild</a> and the <a href="http://www.trumpetguild.org/">International Trumpet Guild</a>, and it’s great to read in their publications about women brass players who are doing well. Every little bit of encouragement helps!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Ways to Support Female Colleagues and Students in the Brass Section</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-large wp-image-2398" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_6582.jpg" width="5133" height="3422" />

As 2017 winds to a close, we'd like to use our final Five Things Friday of the year to make a difference in the community. We spend a lot of time here at Brass Chicks discussing the reality of how things are for us as women playing brass instruments, but sometimes fail to make the connection to what we can do to make things better. Hopefully, the five methods below can help us to help each other and make a change in 2018 and beyond!
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">1. Listen to women</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Go to shows and concerts featuring female musicians, buy albums of work by women, and listen to and play music by female composers. Additionally, show your students that you are doing these things! Lend your students CDs where they can hear female players. Send them YouTube links to videos of your favorite female soloist. In addition to helping out the musicians whose work you share, this can help show the next generation of musicians that brass is not just a men’s game and women are setting a standard of excellence in this field. </span><!--more-->
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">2. Support and encourage female leadership</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Listen to ideas from women in your sections and female conductors/music directors in your ensembles, even if not everyone does. In a patriarchal society, women are </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="http://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/faculty/REST_a_00312.pdf">socialized to be less competitive</a></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> and to speak up for ourselves less. We should do everything we can to counteract that tendency in the music world and amplify the voices of women when we can. Also, support your female colleagues! Be an advocate for the female musicians around you and they will encourage you positively as well. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">For more about empowering other women, we love the book Feminist Fight Club by Jessica Bennett (recommended in a previous Five Things Friday) and </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-wolfson/4-women-offer-advice-on-s_b_10718812.html">this Huffington Post article</a></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> by Rachel Wolfson.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">3. Change the culture and challenge the stereotypes</span></h2>
Call out moments where people make offhand sexist remarks or misogynistic judgements. This also involves catching your own prejudices and working to counteract them. Watch the language used in rehearsals and lessons to describe how a person’s playing sounds. When a student plays assertively, they are not playing “like a man.” A sensitive performance isn’t “feminine.” Do not assume that a player who you do not know is a man, just because of what instrument they play. If someone uses this stereotypical kind of language when you are present, point it out and correct them nicely. These are lazy, harmful shortcuts that make our communication less clear and prevent us from needing to find the words for what we really mean to say. We know that not all doctors are male and not all nurses are female – so why do we act like it's acceptable to assume that a trombone player is a HE and couldn’t be a SHE? Spreading awareness to our audiences is important as well, so they don’t continue to program and support organizations that only promote music performed and composed by white men. If you are a female brass player and you often get comments like “Oh, I never see female tuba players,” then take this as an opportunity to kindly educate this person. "Actually, there are Carol Jantsch, Velvet Brown, Joanna Ross Hersey and many more!" Spreading awareness to our (older) audience is important as well, so they don’t continue to program and support organizations that are only promoting music performed and composed by white men.
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">4. Encourage hiring practices that level the playing field</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Blind auditions </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/orchestrating-impartiality-impact-%E2%80%9Cblind%E2%80%9D-auditions-female-musicians">have been shown</a></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to increase the hiring of female musicians. If you are in a position of power within an orchestra organization (especially a smaller one or a youth ensemble, where a blind system may not already be in place), think about implementing blind auditions through some or all of your audition process. Additionally, beyond the orchestra world, start thinking outside the box for subbing and other gigs. People tend to call their friends or other connections who they trust for jobs. Use the platform you have to promote the work of female artists you admire, and give out the names of female musicians when you have a gig to pass on. If you teach, how many of the students at your institution have a role model who looks like them on the faculty? Seeing mentors of the same gender and race can be incredibly inspiring for students and can help create a more positive and less discriminatory environment for everyone. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">5. Show girls that brass playing is an option for them</span></h2>
Play outreach concerts. If you are interested in teaching, teach clinics in local schools. Children are the future of music, and what they believe is possible defines what will actually be able to happen! Women who play brass instruments have the power to show girls that brass is for them, too, simply by existing and doing what we love.]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">We are excited to have recently conducted an interview over the phone with the incomparable Julie Landsman! Julie was a joy to speak with and offered, unsurprisingly, a wealth of advice and information informed by her career.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h2>About Julie Landsman</h2>
<em><img class="wp-image-2408 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_2183.jpg?w=683" alt="IMG_2183" width="365" height="547" /></em>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Principal horn with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for 25 years, Julie Landsman is a distinguished performing artist and educator. She achieved her dream of becoming principal of the MET in 1985 and held that position until 2010, and has served as a member of the Juilliard faculty since 1989.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Landsman is a current member of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and has performed and recorded with the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. Additionally, she has performed as co-principal with the Houston Symphony, as substitute principal with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, and recently with The Philadelphia Orchestra as associate principal, and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra as principal.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Her students hold positions in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Cincinnati Symphony, San Francisco Opera and Ballet Orchestras, Washington National Opera Orchestra, Dallas Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, New Jersey Symphony, Colorado Symphony, Rochester Philharmonic, and the American Brass Quintet. She recently received the “Pioneer Award” from the International Women’s Brass Conference and was a featured artist at the International Horn Society Conference in 2012 and 2015. Her recent series of Carmine Caruso lessons on YouTube have led to further fame and renown among today’s generation of horn players. Landsman currently resides in Nyack, New York.</em></p>

<h2>Interview</h2>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Brass Chicks:</strong> Your career has been incredible and has taken you all over the world. What was the process of winning your position at the MET and becoming the first woman in the brass section of that orchestra like?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Julie Landsman:</strong> Winning an audition at the MET was one of the greatest experiences of my life. The audition was 100% behind a screen – anonymous – and it’s documented in a very famous book called <em>Blink</em> by Malcolm Gladwell. The last chapter describes the details of  my audition. The men who voted for me had no idea who I was or that I would become the first female brass member of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">After playing three rounds for this audition, the third round ended with the high C from the famous Siegfried long call. I held on to it for about 20 seconds, just in case there was any doubt in their minds, and I heard them start to laugh! Then I knew I had won my dream job. When I walked out from behind the screen, I heard not only applause, but many gasps from the committee of men listening to me. They were shocked to see a young lady walk out from behind the screen. They were so stunned that some of them actually walked to the back of the room, while a handful of them, including my teacher Howard T Howard, heartily congratulated me. I had dreamt of this moment since I was 14 years old and it took until I was 32 to realize my dream job. I was in deep shock when I walked to greet my committee and decided very consciously to make a video recording in my mind to document the moment.  I can picture it right now! My victory lap is well-cemented in my memory bank.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> How much would you say gender colored your experience playing in the MET orchestra?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> I try my best not to tune into that channel. I often compartmentalize my priorities out of necessity. For my early years at the MET, my section consisted of many angry men and my only weapon was to play better than all of them. It drove me to excellence.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> That makes sense.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> My motivation to strive for excellence fit into my competitive and goal oriented personality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Within a 10 year span of being in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the complexion of the orchestra changed dramatically. Four of my wonderful Juilliard students – Michelle Baker, Barbara Jöstlein Currie, Anne Marie Scharer, and Julia Pilant – all joined me to make a compatible section with a gorgeous blended sound.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> In addition to your playing, you're also known for your teaching, in particular for your work with the Caruso method and with your new YouTube series. Could you tell us a little bit about Carmine Caruso, and about those exercises and why we should do them, and if we want to where we should start?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> I’d like to tell you about my exposure to Carmine as a young high school student. My band director in Ardsley, NY, Joe Greco, was a trumpet player and a student of Carmine Caruso. When he brought Carmine into the Ardsley band to work with our musicians, my horn teacher, Howard Howard, also began to work with Carmine. I feel so privileged to have grown up with really great teachers who offered me musical inspiration and a great set of well-trained chops. And where the Caruso fits into playing is that it is training, sort of like going to the gym, so that you’ve got well-balanced chops in all registers with an even response and sound, and you’re then free to play the music from your heart.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Learning the Caruso method at such an early age set me up for success. By focusing on timing and subdivision, it alleviates worry and concern about technique and chops. All of my students learn the Caruso method, and hopefully pass it on through the generations of wonderful horn players to come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have many success stories with my students as documented on my website, <a href="http://julielandsman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">julielandsman.com</a>. Also on this website are the YouTube videos, the printouts of the exercises, and a practice routine.  If you undertake learning the Caruso method, be very mindful to not overdo the exercises because of the extended techniques. Follow the instructions very carefully!</p>
<p dir="ltr">My videos are my tribute to my beloved teacher, Carmine. I adored Carmine. He saved my life, as did horn playing. He was my Mr. Rogers, telling me he liked me just the way I was. Carmine helped to shape my attitude and approach as a horn player and teacher with his non-judgmental and positive AND informative loving support. When Laurie Frink, a wonderful trumpet player and Caruso teacher, passed away, I was inspired to create these videos to preserve the integrity of the Caruso method.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players and, if so, how do you incorporate that or not into your teaching?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> I can say that you need to keep your boundaries and be professional at all times. Even though music is a very personal expression and your relationship with your colleagues can be very personal as well, you need to be very clear where you draw the lines defining who you are as a professional woman and be strong about setting those boundaries so they aren’t crossed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the era of #metoo, it’s extremely important to be mindful of this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in general in today’s climate and, if so, how do you mitigate those?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> We’re losing funding; we’re losing positions and things aren’t as plentiful as they once were for classical musicians. Practice hard, set your dreams and goals, and be the best player you can be! I notice many people are being very creative with how they put themselves out there.  There’s a lot of groups being formed that are more involved in the educational end of things and smaller chamber ensembles that are touring around the world. Many of my students are involved in them. But my jobs with the MET for 25 years and Juilliard for 25 years have kept me highly specialized and focused.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> Do you have any educational resources you’d like to recommend?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> I listen to a wonderful <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tara-brach/id265264862?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meditation podcast</a> by <a href="https://www.tarabrach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara Brach</a>. I listen to her meditations all the time. They’re guided meditations available online for free. Meditation has become an important part of my growth as a human being and of managing performances and trying to learn to stay focused and be as totally present as possible, as well as kind and compassionate. My favorite kind of meditation is metta meditation. There’s another mentor that I have in the meditation world: <a href="http://www.sylviaboorstein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sylvia Boorstein</a>. Between Tara and Sylvia, it keeps me in check with myself and with my heart and with loving kindness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I began my practice in yoga and meditation when I was a student at Juilliard. I was very diligent, and then there'd be something at the end of yoga called savasana, when you go into corpse pose – and I started using visualization. At that time there was a book called <em>Creative Visualization</em>, by Shakti Gawain – all new-age stuff – and I started picturing, in a very relaxed state, my success. I started visualizing audition success and performance success, and I really took it and ran. And then it turned into more of a meditation practice, where I would also get into a very relaxed state when I could do some of my visualization.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<div class="adL">
<div class="im">
<p dir="ltr">There’s a lot of different ways to performance excellence; certainly, being the best possible player you can be, practicing a ton, and having a fabulous teacher is a wonderful underpinning to excellence, but then you have to manage your career. Once you’re there at the top and have professional pressure and public expectation, it doesn’t necessarily get easier. Because the higher you climb, the more you really have to keep your end of the game up. So I highly encourage people to set their dreams and their goals and to take care of all parts of your being; not just as a player, but as a human being. I also swim every day and that keeps me moving and limber and helps my breathing. I used to have a very extensive yoga practice. I now practice Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais Technique. Both physical disciplines lead to coordination of the mind and body, as well as creating new neural pathways where you can reach parts of your nervous system that are very powerful for performance and being a balanced person.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>BC:</strong> Thank you so much, that is some wonderful advice and insight!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>JL:</strong> It's my pleasure!</p>

<hr />

I first started teaching private trombone lessons when I was in college in Texas.  I only had a few students, and they were passed on to me by a friend of mine who didn’t have any more room in his studio.  But when I moved back to my hometown (St. Louis), I knew that teaching private lessons would be an important aspect of my music career and that I needed more than just a handful of students.  I also knew that I had no idea how to acquire said students!

I started building my current low brass studio 5 years ago.  The first few years I worked hard at recruiting to build my studio, but it paid off big time.  At this point I do very little “recruiting” but regularly receive emails and phone calls from parents of prospective new students.  Though my studio is pretty full, things are always changing and it is nice to have a steady flow of new student inquiries.

There are many things you can do to build your own private studio, but here are five suggestions I have. Some may make you say “duh” and some may make you say “are you crazy?!” but they have all played a part in building (and maintaining) my studio.
<h2><b>1. Offer Free Masterclasses</b></h2>
This is by far the number one piece of advice I would give to anyone wanting to start or build their private studio.  Offer to do free masterclasses at schools.  The point of these masterclasses are to meet potential new students and have them see you in person and get an idea of who you are and how you teach, but also (and more importantly) to start building relationships with band directors.  For me, this was crucial in building and maintaining my studio, but I’ll get to more of that later. <!--more-->

Look up the different schools in your area (or the area in which you’d like to teach) and email all of the band directors.  Email them <i>individually</i> so it is more personal, introduce yourself, tell them what you do/play, tell them you have space open in your private studio, and offer to do a FREE MASTERCLASS for their students.  Keep the email short and sweet (they are band directors, after all, and have no time).

Because you are emailing band directors who get a million emails a day and have no time, you probably will not get a response to your first email.  That’s okay - it’s nothing personal.  Follow up with a second email a week or two later and they will more likely be appreciative rather than annoyed that you did.  After you do a masterclass, send a follow up email to the band director thanking them for having you in and giving them info about lessons and your private studio.

I would recommend sending these emails out once every semester to new schools or band directors that you have NOT done a masterclass with, and once a year (beginning of the school year) for schools that DID bring you in for a masterclass.  I did masterclasses for the first three school years when I moved back to St. Louis.
<h2><b>2. Have Honest and Specific Testimonials</b></h2>
Having solid testimonials online will help build your “social proof,” making potential clients more comfortable choosing you as a teacher.  A great way to garner honest and specific testimonials that speak directly to your target audience (aka parents/students/band directors) is to create a survey of 3-5 questions with answers than can be crafted into a strong statement about you/your teaching.  This can easily be done using online tools like Survey Monkey or Google Docs.  One of my favorite testimonials came from a parent as a result of a survey I sent out to a few of my students and their parents.

<i>“My son has become progressively more dedicated to learning to play the trombone.  I think he sees what value there is to playing well, and Gabe has helped him on his quest.  I am a musician, and have knowledge as to what is good or bad.  Gabe is good.  Not only has she inspired my son, she has exposed him to many outside the lesson opportunities, all of which were valuable and interesting to him.  Gabe is a motivated, innovative, top notch music teacher.”</i>

I was able to put together this testimonial using answers from targeted questions I asked in a survey regarding my teaching methods and pedagogy.  Examples of those questions were, “Please describe the changes you have seen in yourself/your student as a result of taking lessons with Gabe” and “Please explain how you/your student has benefited from Gabe’s specific pedagogy/brass playing concepts.”

Determine what you want your testimonials to say about you and your teaching and create questions that will help guide your current students and parents in providing answers that will be useful for testimonials.  Even if you only have one student, getting a strong testimonial from them, their parents, and even their band directors is a good start!
<h2><b>3. Make a Video</b></h2>
The Internet and the people who use it love video.  There are so many places you can put a video to reach potential students/parents (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, your website).  I highly recommend making a video that shows people what it’s like to take lessons with you and be a part of your private studio.  It doesn’t have to be fancy or long, just genuine and informative.

It is relatively easy to make a short simple video on your own.  If you don’t have the skills to make a video, I think it is a smart investment to hire someone who can do it for you.  Here is a video that I had made for my private studio:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-ciqGSgJRPQ">https://youtu.be/-ciqGSgJRPQ</a>  The whole video is on the longer side and resides on my website and YouTube channel, but I was able to pull snippets of it to post on social media.
<h2><b>4. Be Visible and Accessible</b></h2>
Make sure people know who you are and what it is you do!  There are a number of ways to be visible, both online and in person.  If you don’t already have a website or Facebook page, go make one now!  There are a variety of online tools to help you build websites and/or an effective Facebook page.  (And once you do that, include those testimonials and videos!)  Make it as easy as possible for people to find information about you and your services online, along with how to contact you via email or phone.

I also find it helpful to go out into the world, be social, meet new people, and do a little self-promotion.  Perform in community ensembles in your area to meet other musicians.  Attend local, state, or national clinics and conferences to connect with other music educators.  Look up your local arts council and attend meetings, workshops, or other events.  You never know who you will meet that will connect you to future students (and gigs!).  Have business cards on hand to pass out when you meet people in real life.
<h2><b>5. Foster and Maintain Relationships</b></h2>
As I mentioned earlier, band directors can be your best friends and lifelines when it comes to building and maintaining your private studio.  As long as you are teaching lessons, you need to continue to foster these relationships.  Keep in contact with them by sending a quick email updating them on their students’ progress.  Get their input on things like solo &amp; ensemble repertoire selection.  Attend your students’ band concerts and say hello to the band directors before or afterwards.  Show them that you are present and that you value their music program and their students.

This may seem like the simplest of my 5 things, but I think it is the most important.  Even when you have a full studio you will always need a stream of new students.  If you play your cards right, you will get to a point where you won’t have to do as much recruiting as when you first started out.  I personally do very little recruiting at this point but still get new student requests regularly through band director referrals.  Maintain good relationships with your band director colleagues and you will always have students in your future!
Good luck to you if you are building your private studio!  Teaching private lessons is sometimes tough, but also magical - enjoy the ride!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Happy Friday! We know the semester is starting for those of us academics, gigs may be picking up, and regular post-holiday life is now in full swing. We hope everyone is moving along steadily towards their goals and that this post from Brass Chicks’ very own Kate Amrine can help if you find yourself in a difficult spot.</em>

The following are five struggles that I've found musicians face throughout their careers. Most of these are equal-opportunity offenders, meaning they can affect you regardless or your age or experience level. Fortunately, I've included some info on how to move past them so feel free to share with anyone who may need to hear these messages.

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2418" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nathan-dumlao-263787.jpg?w=1024" alt="nathan-dumlao-263787" width="599" height="399" />
<h2>1. Lack of Money</h2>
This is the most obvious problem so let's start with it! Of course, lack of money can hit everyone at various points in their careers but is especially an issue for those of us just graduating school. Especially when not every music school provides us with skills and a concrete plan to make a living in music after graduating, it is extremely important to figure out what is best for us individually and make a plan. In addition to funding projects or music expenses we may have (starting a group, making an album, going on tour, marketing), we all have living expenses such rent, food, and student loans to reckon with. <!--more-->

Rather than complain about how hard it can be to make a living in music, figure out the best way to do the things you want to do. Maybe that means a day job so you can perform in the evening, or a part-time job with flexibility to teach private lessons in the afternoon. Personally, I have worked many different kinds of jobs – some were great, some were not – but I used them at the time to handle my living expenses so I could focus on practicing, performing, and what I really wanted to be doing. We have all heard about the benefits of having multiple streams of income, and most professional musicians do it: they teach, perform, and often work in other areas as a clinician for masterclasses and more.

In addition to working, the other important thing to think about is saving money! When I was doing my master's degree at Peabody, I stayed with my parents in Maryland when I was in town for school so that I could keep my rent stabilized apartment in NYC. This obviously saved me a considerable amount of money and I was very fortunate to be able to borrow my mom's car when I needed it to drive to school. Thanks Mom! &lt;3

One more money-related thing to think about is quality of life. We have all heard the myth of the starving artist, broke college student, poor musician, etc. But it doesn't have to be like that. Sometimes people make choices to save money or earn additional money with a day job, extra students, or another option. You might do this for a variety of reasons – maybe you are saving up for a down payment or having a child or maybe you just want to be able to go out to eat more often and have a different quality of life.

Regardless of your personal situation, own your choices and feel confident in them! Believe that you are doing everything you can do to be where you want to be, and be positive and confident that your work will take you there. Don't listen to other people telling you about the difficulties of being an artist or retelling the stereotypical negative narrative.  You know your situation and you have the power to do whatever YOU want and create your own reality.
<h2>2. Lack of Time</h2>
This one is another big one, especially for working musicians, teachers, and others balancing many responsibilities. It feels like there are simply not enough hours in the day! But what if there can be?

It can be very difficult to manage practicing, warming up, working out, eating right, having a social life, and teaching. While I am certainly not an expert at this, there is often a way to make it all work out. Do you plan your day so that you know what you are realistically going to do for each hour? Do you have a set of weekly goals and to-do items as well as longer-term goals? Are you able to delegate tasks to an assistant or colleague who may be able to help in busier times? Lastly, are your priorities where you want them to be? Some days are so crazy that it is impossible to do everything, but it helps to be sure to put your "must-do" items first every day. For me, those items are getting a good warm up, maintaining a consistent practice routine, and eating healthy. Another big challenge in getting everything done is accounting for last-minute changes. That brings me to the next issue:
<h2><strong>3. Being Flexible</strong></h2>
This is one of the first skills I ever learned in New York City. There are SO many things that can change in the daily life of a musician and, if you are stubborn and unable to adjust in those situations, then you will become very angry, be frustrated with your circumstances, and possibly not be hired back for gigs. I am sure we all have many stories about times when things didn't go according to plan or where we had to adjust. Some cases I have encountered over the years include: travel issues (NYC subway... need I say more?), music being in a different key and having to transpose, no music being provided and playing by ear, the location of a gig changing at the last minute, a performance time getting pushed later so it was at 2 am instead of midnight, students cancelling, students being unprepared, someone forgetting something I needed, and many more. Of course there are times when one or two of these situations or something else will happen and it can be difficult to adjust but, for the most part, I have learned to be flexible. One of the greatest things about many music careers is the flexibility they afford. Being able to play the type of music we want to, create our own hours, choose who we want to play with, choose where we want to perform, and so on is a great source of freedom. With the good stuff, though, comes some bad stuff. How will you choose to deal with it?
<h2>4. Being unsatisfied with your place in the music business</h2>
Speaking of "dealing with it," let's talk about this problem. This widespread dissatisfaction is perhaps the most important one of all. I would venture to guess that every musician has experienced this setback at some point in their careers and will, in fact, probably experience it more than once. The best thing about this problem is that it can happen to anyone regardless of experience level or place on the totem pole :)

First of all, there is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to be at a different point in your career. Maybe you are a student and you are tired of taking music history and theory classes and would rather be practicing and taking auditions. Maybe you are a freelancer who wants to move up and do some bigger gigs. Maybe you have a adjunct teaching position but are trying to move towards a tenured position so you can start building a family and feel settled. It can happen to anyone! The key point here is how to handle it. It can be easy to look around and be jealous of other people's success and situations. Are you going to sit in your position, wallow in your situation, and complain to those around you? Believe me, I've tried that and it doesn't work!

After I finished my undergrad at NYU, I stayed in the city and began to teach and freelance more. After two years of this, I became very frustrated with my place in the scene and wanted to be doing bigger and better things. I knew that, to do this, I needed to go back to school so I handled my situation by going and my getting my master's at Peabody. My personal experience isn't here to tell you to go back to school or tell you that another degree is the answer, but rather to show that the solution or a way out of an uncomfortable situation often involves taking a first step that might seem risky or out of reach. Fortunately, there are many resources at your disposal to help you. Talking to former teachers, colleagues, or fellow students for advice is a great one. Buy these people coffee or a meal, explain your situation, and figure out how you can be on a better path. There are also a huge variety of books, blogs (like this one!), and podcasts on every topic from preparing for orchestra auditions to building a freelancing career. Check those out and take advantage of the resources available to you!

Lastly, the most recent time I felt truly unsatisfied with my place in the music business was in September, 2017, when I had finished recording my album and was gearing up to release it. I posted on Facebook asking my friends whether my album cover should be my face or an abstract painting. Of course I got many responses (some helpful and some not), but the best part of that situation was that it led me to begin working with <a href="https://cubidesartists.com/">Karen Cubides</a>, who has been unbelievably helpful in coaching me on my career. Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice when you need it! It might just be the exact thing that you needed to change your position :)
<h2><strong>5. Feeling unfocused, unmotivated, and uninspired
</strong></h2>
Honestly, this is something that I don't experience very often. I do get little glimpses of it occasionally, though. Sometimes after a big performance I come home and I have no idea what to practice or, if I don't have any upcoming gigs, it can be difficult to get in as many hours of playing as I normally do. I have heard from colleagues that this comes up a lot after losing big auditions and other difficult situations. I am sure that comparing oneself to others who are either the same age as you or doing what you want to be doing doesn't help this situation. In terms of a solution or remedy to this struggle I offer two suggestions:

First, keeping in mind everything from my previous four points. Are you actively working on the things that you want to get better at? Do you know what you need to get better at? If these are problems for you, start by taking a lesson with someone great and figure out a plan of action! Personally, I have a running list of aspects of my playing I am always trying to improve. Ray Mase recommended that system to me and it has been unbelievably helpful keeping me on track at times where I might have felt lost and frustrated. Sec

ond, remember the WHY! Why do you play music? Go see a concert or listen to some great performances online. I always feel inspired after hearing great musicians play. It makes me excited to get home and practice as well as just simply be a musician so that I have the power to have that same effect on people. This can also be accomplished by playing music with friends. Duets or quintets can be a great way to have fun, make great music, and get back on an inspiring track.]]></content:encoded>

I am so excited to be this week’s Five Things Friday guest contributor. Sharing my perspective, throwing my two cents into the pot, adding more online content to this topic is so important for women who are freelancers and brass players. You can balance family AND a brass playing career and it’s about time we celebrate! Below I will be sharing my ideas related to freelancing and brass playing from my own new mommy angle. My hope is that my article allows room for conversation among current brass mamas and provides avenues of support for future brass mamas out there.

Without further adieu, the five things I learned about freelancing after having my first child:

Projects…

Before becoming pregnant, I worked...A LOT. When I wasn’t playing horn or practicing horn or reading about how to be a better horn player, I was teaching or preparing lesson plans for teaching or reading about how to be a better teacher. And if I had any extra time in my schedule, I would practice more or find more odds and ends jobs to keep busy. So naturally when I finished my last official full day of work before having my baby, it was a sad day in a way for me...until I had an epiphany--projects! Although my main job right now is taking care of my baby and reading about how to take better care of my baby. However, my workaholic brain has become 1000 times more sane after discovering key projects that compliment the motherhood lifestyle as well as push me closer to my professional goals. One of the first projects I found after life at home settled into a groove was “Crushing Classical.” The podcasts put out by Tracy and Eileen are an easy, hands-free way to continue to explore my career. And the challenges and courses that they offer through their Facebook group gave me the tools and motivation to continue to push ahead when it would have been so easy to sit on the couch and become a daytime tv zombie. Another project that has helped to keep me motivated and balanced in my career is involvement in the performance of Stockhausen’s KLANG in April. The horn movement, NEBADON, involves coordination with a narrator and electronics, is very open to musical interpretation of the notes on the page, and standard performance practice dictates it be performed from memory. Needless to say, this project requires daily attention and I am so thankful to be a part of it. The last project I have been working on is launching my own business called Concertino Kids. Combining all of the things I loved learning about music as a young child and sharing it with others has been a dream of mine for a long time and it has been wonderful seeing this idea come to life.

Pacing…

About nine years ago, I decided to participate in my first triathlon. It was an all-female series that is now defunct but I am happy to say that a new all-female triathlon is coming to Philadelphia this summer. Anyway, my goal of doing this triathlon was to just do it and make it to the finish line. It was an extremely empowering experience and I have since raced in nearly twenty triathlon events with the simple goals of no stopping and making it to the finish line. The longest race I finished took 7 or 8 hours to complete--1 mile swim, 40 mile bike, 6.2 mile run. I also coached a youth triathlon camp the week before my son was born. One thing I took away from these experiences with triathlon directly parallels something I learned about playing during and after pregnancy--pacing is key. Your body goes through different stages--3 sports in triathlon, 3 trimesters in pregnancy--and it is your job to listen to your body and react accordingly to maximize your output.

Nausea played a big part of my early pregnancy pacing. Breaks during practice sessions, scheduling shorter but more frequent practice sessions when possible, developing a hyper-focused practice plan with all upcoming gigs in mind, and always keeping a water bottle nearby are all ways I was able to stay in shape and prepared despite the nausea.

Midway through pregnancy I experienced days of extreme exhaustion. Working a full time day job that involved jumping around with hundreds of kids per week, freelancing or practicing many nights until 10pm or later, significantly cutting out my usual caffeine consumption, and adding in the ocaissonal middle-of-the-night wakings...it was bound to happen. During this time I forced myself to evaluate and compartmentalize my obligations. Lesson planning for my day job had to be completed during times that would not interfere with getting as close to 7 or 8 hours of sleep per night as possible. I held myself to a strict, no excuses practice routine focused on aspects of my playing that usually deteriorate more quickly than others (endurance and articulation) and the repertoire of upcoming freelancing gigs. I even took an audition as a means of keeping a definite playing project in mind during this time. I forced myself to nap, even if only for 30 minutes, on days when I had a little break between day job and freelancing. I also used strategically timed limited consumption of caffeinated soda when necessary.

Heading into and through my third trimester, I found my pacing efforts needed to be centered around breathing and posture. My body felt so different each time I approached the horn. I had to adjust the way I positioned my bell to accommodate my growing belly. And my breathing was best when I maintained a consistent practice routine.

After the arrival of the baby, I took my time reapproaching the horn. Pain management and scheduling were my pacing mechanism during the recovery period. I paid close attention to any pain or tightness I felt during my early playing stages and relied heavily on buzzing to rebuild. One of the most helpful playing routines that I used during this time and also use every day for general maintenance is Marian Hesse’s “Daily Routines for Horn.” It targets all of the cornerstones of playing in such an approachable way. For fitting in practice time, I buzzed and played quiet long tones while the baby napped nearby in his Rock ’n Play. As the baby’s awake time increased, I made sure to work with my husband and his work schedule so that I would have daily “off baby duty” time to practice.

Priorities...

Every freelancer is faced with the dilemma of priorities when it comes to the gig offers they choose to accept. It is a game of setting limits--rate of pay, distance to travel, type of music, ensemble, time of gig, the list goes on. There are two extremes to this game--people who set very specific criteria for whether or not they will accept a gig offer and people who have virtually no limits to the gigs they will play. There was a time when I would take each and every gig I was fortunate enough to be offered for the playing and networking experience. However, I knew people who would say no to certain opportunities in a black and white kind of way (ie--no ringer gigs). Although I still am so thankful every time the phone rings for a gig and believe in evaluating options on a case by case basis, the priorities have shifted and the fact that every gig is a choice has become even more clear to me. Factoring in the need for, availability and cost of a sitter is the obvious difference between pre and post baby but it is a bit more complicated a decision, a case by case situation. I am also aware now more than ever of the opportunity to not only play with but socialize with my fellow colleagues on the job which is an amazing perk to this ever-changing tundra of a profession.

People...

Everyone always says it takes a village but what does that mean? For the longest time, I measured my village by the Hallmark Card standard--lots of family living close by always there eager to watch your child for free, or an impeccably rated and reasonably priced daycare, everyone watching your child automatically knowing exactly how to care for them just as you would, no unsolicited advice or judgement in sight. What ridiculous assumptions and expectations!!! I have found over time that my family’s village presents in a different way but it is most definitely there and it is amazing. It consists of the family and friends but also colleagues (present and past) and students and students’ families. It has been such a positive experience discovering this village and seeing the strengths and interest of each member of my village shine around my family and our son. Your village is defined by you.

Positivity...

One of the most important things I learned about freelancing after having a baby is that I am surrounded by some amazing, accomplished and encouraging moms. There are three people in particular who I would like to acknowledge and highlight for their openness in sharing their experiences in balancing motherhood with their professional careers. Their positivity and advice this past year helped me to better understand myself and the best decisions to make for my career and family throughout my pregnancy journey. Dr. Catherine Nelson, a friend from our horn playing and music teaching days at The College of New Jersey, works with children every day whether its her own two boys or the patients at the hospital where she is completing her residency. Katie’s tips and encouragement came from her knowledge as a doctor, as a new mom with her second child on the way, as someone who has a passion for running and races equal to my triathlon hobby, and as a horn player. Its nice to have all of those perspectives rolled up into one. Audrey Flores was another person who I reached out to during my pregnancy. Job security in freelancing is incredibly unpredictable depending on so many factors but Audrey helped put my fears of physical recovery, figuring out practicing with a new baby in the house, and overall perception of me as a player during and after pregnancy at bay. Another important mentor I had during my pregnancy was Heather Murphy-Monteith. Her words of wisdom came from a place of experience balancing her career as a dancer, entrepreneur, and education manager with motherhood. Our professional relationship, having existed years before I became pregnant, allowed me to feel comfortable in creating a space to discuss both pregnancy in the workplace and ways I could further my career while pregnant.

I would be lying if I said I did not encounter my fair share of unprofessionalism, insensitive commentary, and unsolicited tummy touching during pregnancy. However, the positivity shown to me far outweighed any unwanted attention I received. It is difficult enough to go through such dramatic physical and mental changes that focusing on the positives is most important anyway. Find your mentor, someone who does what you do or what you want to do and who has been in your shoes and who you feel comfortable speaking with. It really does make a world of difference!

It has been fun reflecting on freelancing, brass playing and having a child. This topic is so often set aside as too taboo to bring to open discussion. I will be honest that there was a voice in my head during my pregnancy reminding me of the inner dialogue many female freelancers and brass players have held or continue to hold onto as their truths--build your career THEN think about building your family, choosing music as a career means that you will be too poor to have kids, having kids means no time to practice, having kids means you are a mom first and then a musician. The real truth is that a Classical musician’s career is constantly evolving and never truly done “being built,” you make time for what matters, work-life balance is possible and being a great musician AND a great mom are two different things both achievable by one single individual.

I am so excited to be this week’s Five Things Friday guest contributor. Sharing my perspective, throwing my two cents into the pot, adding more online content to this topic is so important for women who are freelancers and brass players. You can balance family AND a brass playing career and it’s about time we celebrate! Below I will be sharing my ideas related to freelancing and brass playing from my own new mommy angle. My hope is that my article allows room for conversation among current brass mamas and provides avenues of support for future brass mamas out there.

Without further adieu, the five things I learned about freelancing after having my first child:

Projects…

Before becoming pregnant, I worked...A LOT. When I wasn’t playing horn or practicing horn or reading about how to be a better horn player, I was teaching or preparing lesson plans for teaching or reading about how to be a better teacher. And if I had any extra time in my schedule, I would practice more or find more odds and ends jobs to keep busy. So naturally when I finished my last official full day of work before having my baby, it was a sad day in a way for me...until I had an epiphany--projects! Although my main job right now is taking care of my baby and reading about how to take better care of my baby. However, my workaholic brain has become 1000 times more sane after discovering key projects that compliment the motherhood lifestyle as well as push me closer to my professional goals. One of the first projects I found after life at home settled into a groove was “Crushing Classical.” The podcasts put out by Tracy and Eileen are an easy, hands-free way to continue to explore my career. And the challenges and courses that they offer through their Facebook group gave me the tools and motivation to continue to push ahead when it would have been so easy to sit on the couch and become a daytime tv zombie. Another project that has helped to keep me motivated and balanced in my career is involvement in the performance of Stockhausen’s KLANG in April. The horn movement, NEBADON, involves coordination with a narrator and electronics, is very open to musical interpretation of the notes on the page, and standard performance practice dictates it be performed from memory. Needless to say, this project requires daily attention and I am so thankful to be a part of it. The last project I have been working on is launching my own business called Concertino Kids. Combining all of the things I loved learning about music as a young child and sharing it with others has been a dream of mine for a long time and it has been wonderful seeing this idea come to life.

Pacing…

About nine years ago, I decided to participate in my first triathlon. It was an all-female series that is now defunct but I am happy to say that a new all-female triathlon is coming to Philadelphia this summer. Anyway, my goal of doing this triathlon was to just do it and make it to the finish line. It was an extremely empowering experience and I have since raced in nearly twenty triathlon events with the simple goals of no stopping and making it to the finish line. The longest race I finished took 7 or 8 hours to complete--1 mile swim, 40 mile bike, 6.2 mile run. I also coached a youth triathlon camp the week before my son was born. One thing I took away from these experiences with triathlon directly parallels something I learned about playing during and after pregnancy--pacing is key. Your body goes through different stages--3 sports in triathlon, 3 trimesters in pregnancy--and it is your job to listen to your body and react accordingly to maximize your output.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are thrilled to have been able to conduct an interview with the fabulous Abbie Conant. Abbie famously fought the Munich Philharmonic for 11 years in court to be solo trombone and now performs groundbreaking multidisciplinary works. She has been a pleasure to work with on this interview!
<h2>About Abbie Conant</h2><img src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abbie-clear.jpg" class="wp-image-2460 alignleft" height="317" alt="abbie clear" width="216">Award-winning Performance artist and Juilliard-trained trombonist Abbie Conant is somewhat of a legend in the international orchestral brass world. The story of her epic fight and ultimate victory against egregious gender discrimination in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, where she won the position for principal trombone at a screened audition in 1980, inspired author Malcolm Gladwell to write the NY Times Bestseller, <em>Blink,</em> where Ms. Conant’s story is detailed in the last chapter. The 11-year-long court battle was documented by composer/musicologist/activist, William Osborne, in an article entitled “You Sound Like a Ladies’ Orchestra.” The document is supported by actual court records and experiences in the orchestra with 89 footnotes. This source document has generated countless newspaper and magazine article (Der Spiegel, {the German analog to Time Magazine}, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, etc.) as well as a documentary film, (Abbie Conant, Alone Among Men by Brenda Parkerson), a play produced at the Landestheater Linz, Austria by Award-winning British playwright, Tamssin Oglesby called, Der (eingebildeter) Frauenfeind, (The [Concieted] Misogynist) and a screen play for a feature film in the works by Canadian writer/producer Dale Wolf.

After winning her lengthy court case, Ms. Conant won a full-tenured Professorship at the University of Music in Trossingen, Germany and left the orchestra in 1993. Abbie Conant has performed instrumental music theater works with surround sound electronics in over 150 different cities around the world. She has given masterclasses in as many esteemed music institution such as The Juilliard School, The Eastman School, New England Conservatory, Yale School of Music, Indiana University, Royal Northern College of Music, the Academy of Music and Drama in Gothenburg, Sweden, DePaul, CalArts, McGill, Oberlin and many others. In collaboration with composer/husband William Osborne, the pair has created a new genre of chamber music theater. They have produced five evening-length chamber operas for singing/acting trombonist.
<h2>Interview</h2><strong>1. Your story of battling sexism and discrimination in the orchestra world with the Munich Philharmonic is unbelievable, yet your strength and determination (and great playing of course!) paved the way for many discussions and policies on sexism in the brass world. Have your thoughts on that experience changed in any way? Especially in light of recent events in classical music and political culture with harassment and this kind of behavior being less tolerated in the public eye? </strong><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400;">My thoughts about my experience in the Munich Philharmonic haven’t changed. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, the treatment I received seemed unthinkable and of another era. It is common for women to expect decent, fair treatment in the workplace and find out that their male – and sometimes female – co-workers aren’t very conscious about these issues. Once people learn to recognize the behavioral patterns of sexism, racism and other forms of bigotry, the problems and their sources become clear. Action can then be taken. This wasn’t the case in the MPhil. The atmosphere was like the 1950s. The women musicians, all 7 of them at the time I entered in 1980, wore dresses to rehearsals with long sleeves and conservative necklines.  If a woman’s concert gown showed too much skin, a self-appointed, stone-faced, elderly and creepy cellist would sidle up to her and warn her to cover up.  Nowadays, that simply wouldn’t happen. But to me, back then, it was appalling that a man would have anything to say about what we wore.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Men in groups still need to change their views about women and women need to develop zero tolerance for sexual harassment, sexual abuse and discrimination in any form. It doesn’t mean we have to become aggressive, necessarily, but we do have to expect to be treated with decency and professionalism at school and in the workplace. Basic respect is not a difficult behavior to master. Everyone knows what it is, what it feels like and how it creates harmony and brings out the highest potential of any group of humans working together. When I look back at my Munich experience, it is sometimes hard for me to believe that I survived the concentric aggression of that institution.  You describe my experience as a battle, and it certainly was, but not in the sense that immediately comes to mind – a sort of tumultuous, even messy, series of aggressive, angry confrontations. It was more like being on an ice floe without a coat in the middle of a vast ocean with no land in sight. Oddly, I was well-liked and was always congenial with my colleagues. So it confused me when a few of them seemed to want to destroy me. It was a deep, cold hatred of women who were, in their minds, “out of place.” This is a matter of human evolution and the raising of consciousness.</span>

<strong>2. Tell us about your work as a soloist with music theater pieces. Playing trombone, singing, and acting all in the same performance is incredibly inspiring and changes the game in creating a whole new body of repertoire and responsibilities for a performer.</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">In 1983, my husband, composer William Osborne completed a 45 minute work for acting soprano/trombonist with piano accompaniment using text from the play, </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Happy Days</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">, by the great existentialist playwright Samuel Beckett.  William auditioned several operatic sopranos and decided that he needed a different kind of text delivery than the florid, bel canto park and bark tradition. He told me OK, you have a year to learn to sing.  At a music festival, I met a dramatic soprano in the dorm who happened to live in Munich who said she could teach me to sing. I believed her even though I couldn’t imagine myself singing a score like </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Winnie. </i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">It was all over the place, the tessitura, the tricky intervals, the span of the piece, let alone the acting!  We set to work sometimes scheduling 2 to 3 lessons a week. On top of that I had Alexander Technique lessons which helped immensely with poise and vocal production. In short, I premiered William Osborne’s </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Winnie </i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">at a festival in Rome, Italy.  </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">During that same year I took workshops in pantomime, clowning, modern dance and mask work with great people. I had had some basic training as an undergrad at Temple University in mime which was incredibly helpful for defining stage movement. The score had dozens of specific movements timed to the music that had to be utterly precise and yet be natural looking and convincing. William directed me and we worked out basic principles of acting through observation and books.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">William set two additional Beckett works for me to create an evening length trilogy comprised of </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Winnie, Act Without Words I, and Rockaby.</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">  </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Act Without Words I</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a work for pantomime, and is a tour de force in terms of athletic, almost acrobatic movement, as well as rope climbing. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The next piece was the </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Miriam Trilogy</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> which was a direct artistic and emotional response to what I had been going through in the Munich Philharmonic. This was a 90 minute, non-stop work in three parts: </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>The Mirror, The Chair</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">, and</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i> The River.</i></span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When we began work on the piece, the emotions in it were so intense and close to the bone for me that it took several hours to feel normal again. It is challenging to go into such a devastating place every rehearsal of the piece! The Mirror is pure mime, mask work and trombone playing. Miriam is trying to find her identity as an artist, as a woman. At the end she tries to take her own life by swallowing a lot of pills.  In the second part of the trilogy, </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>The Chair</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">, she is restrained in a large chair. There are clamps that snap down when she becomes too agitated. The whole thing looks like a cross between a child’s high chair made for an adult and a sort of torture chair. When the clamps release her hands, she reaches for her trombone and plays what words cannot express. There is a demo video that gives one an idea of what I do: </span>

<a href="http://www.osborne-conant.org/Miriam.htm"><span style="font-weight:400;">http://www.osborne-conant.org/Miriam.htm</span></a>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Our next work was </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Street Scene for the Last Soprano</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> which is about a homeless woman living in a dumpster who thinks she has an audition for the Met the next day.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Then came </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Cybeline, </i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">a work about a cyborg who is trying to prove to scientists that she is human by being a talk show host. I perform along with a video using hundreds of cartoons I drew. The images represent the inside of my cyborg mind. The work explores the relationship between women, nature, and technology. Its pretty whacky. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">After that came </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Alethia</i></span><span style="font-weight:400;"> with which we will tour for two months in the Northeastern USA from mid-February to mid-April, 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Now to answer your question!  I believe that musicians of the future will be trained in a holistic and comprehensive way that not only demands the highest standards of instrumental performance but also vocal production, movement training, acting, diction, directing, set design, lighting, production, video, sound design, text writing and composition.  All of these elements of music theater directly relate to and enhance brass performance. Just standing there with a music stand in front of you like a shield in some sort of battle simply won’t be enough. It already isn’t enough.  We can make bigger, more total statements of great relevance and power. Of course, it takes time and effort to learn these other skills, but it imbues one’s playing with breadth and depth of expression.</span>

<strong>3. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own or when teaching?</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The challenges are mighty these days!  Orchestras are being defunded if they haven’t already vanished due to lack of arts funding. Teaching jobs are tremendously competitive and require a doctorate, which can plunge a young person into serious debt before they have even begun to earn money. There are some successful chamber groups out there, but most members still have to have a teaching job to support their chamber music habit. There is a deterioration of the ability to focus in general. The addictive quality of smartphones and tablets can undo the most disciplined individual. It is as if we are being trained to be scattered and perhaps a bit jaded by all the virtual stimulation and interaction…and our world appears to be in a massive tumult!</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I observed that many students have little moral support in general. They see their teacher once or twice a week and they have their friends, but no one is teaching them survival tactics or common-sense strategies to survive in the world they will be tossed out into!  I have developed a class at my university called Evolving as an Artist.  We work on learning tools for artistic, emotional, mental and physical well-being. The class itself becomes a supportive community for each of its members. At the same time, they learn how to deal with difficult people, how to clear their minds, how to stay creative and self-loving no matter what, how to present themselves, how to practice more efficiently, how to create and achieve goals and much more. So I feel I am doing my part to help them cope with this rather shape-shifting world.</span>

<strong>4. Is there anything you wish you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I learned that being in school is not at all like being out of school. I wish I had had a course in how to deal with difficult people. People who want to harm you. People who like to make trouble for the entertainment value it brings to their empty lives and souls. I needed to know that just because you are a nice person doesn’t vaccinate you against sadists, psychopaths, and the envious and jealous. There is nothing quite like sitting next to a passive-aggressive person in an ensemble for several decades to challenge your mental strength! It is the rotten apple in the barrel of great, kind and lovely people who can destroy your peace of mind, sense of safety, and self-confidence. And I just happen to know of a great book for dealing with these issues: </span><span style="font-weight:400;"><i>Pulling Your Own Strings </i></span><span style="font-weight:400;">by Dr. Wayne Dyer. It may be out-of-print but this book helped me more than anything in terms of handling my monsters. </span>

<strong>5. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life, etc.</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><em>Happy <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Friday</span></span>! This post is a shortened and slightly altered version of a <a href="https://youtu.be/-v_7vIE7T9I">Facebook Live chat </a>I did back in December about how I got started freelancing in New York City. It originally had over 200 views so I decided to upload it to Youtube so it lives there now :)</em></div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature">
<div><img class="spotlight alignleft" src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/300046_10100921013029323_87566154_n.jpg?oh=dc15f75d35e5175ff0e75b9ac8051232&amp;oe=5B24C796" alt="" width="253" height="380" /></div>
</div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature">

<em>Do you find yourself wishing you were performing more? Perhaps you just graduated and you are looking to get your start in a new city. Or maybe you recently quit your teaching job to focus more on performing.  These points should be possible for you regardless of your instrument, point in your career, or location.
</em>

</div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature"><em> </em></div>
<div><em>&lt;&lt; This pictures is a fun #fbf to one of my first gigs in NYC several years ago - playing with <a href="http://pitchblakbrassband.com/">Pitch Blak Brass Band</a>. Some of the people in that group I still play with on gigs today and I was originally put in contact with the group through one of the other trumpet players.</em></div>
<div><em>So, here are five people / organizations to contact that could get you more work. Hope this helps! </em></div>
<!--more-->
<div>

<hr />

</div>
<div></div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature"><b>1. Colleagues that play the same instrument as you</b></div>
<div>

This one seems obvious but I'm putting it first because it is the most important. Much of the freelance work I've gotten is from subbing for friends and other connections. This is great because these people you probably already know: people you recently performed with, colleagues from school, other freelancers in your area. Contact them and meet for lunch or coffee, or a drink. Maybe put together a reading session and play some duets or brass quintets. This is especially great because you are in close contact with these people, playing and hanging out. So they hear how you play and how you are to interact with – and thus may feel comfortable recommending you to sub for them or for a gig that they can't do. Similarly, you can ask them how they got their start or if they have any recommendations for other playing opportunities.

<b>2. Other colleagues that don't play your instrument </b>

</div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature">

This one seems a little less obvious but bear with me. You might think or wonder if or why a bassoon player would ever recommend you to play trombone with an orchestra but the simple answer is you never know. This person could be the contractor or happened to be in the same room as the contractor when they asked if they knew any trombone players and your name came up. Maybe this non brass player is putting together a chamber music concert and might want your group to play. The more people that know you as a person and as a musician is in your best interest to be working as much as possible.

<b>3. Teachers or other freelancers who you admire </b>

Take a lesson or treat someone to drinks or a meal. Pick their brain about freelancing: explain what you want to be doing or the problems you are facing and inquire as to how to do better. Playing for someone who you respect can be a great way to get better (obviously!) but also to learn what may be needed to change your freelance situation. Maybe you aren't ready to do the kinds of gigs that you want to be doing... and finding that out in a lesson is a lot better than finding out on the gig ;)  I've gotten a couple gigs from teachers and they can be amazing opportunities so you never know! This category of people is great because most likely, they have been in your position wanting to work more, understand how you feel, and may be willing to help you.

<b>4. Local groups and Organizations like Churches and/or Community Theaters etc</b>

Want to play more orchestra gigs? Have you reached out and introduced yourself to all of the community groups in your area or local colleges that may hire ringers? What about going to a concert and meeting with people involved before or after? There are many ways to go in this direction but I think the best way in my opinion is personally - as in - in person with your physical presence rather than sending many cold emails. Of course cold emails are great and necessary and everyone does them – but if you can, sometimes showing up to meet someone in person or support a group's performance can be even more valuable and memorable for the group potentially hiring you and for you – to see if it is even a group you want to be involved with anyways. For things where an email or showing up might not be appropriate, consider asking a friend involved in one of these organizations to mention you in an introduction email or ask if you could drop their name to start the conversation. Sometimes groups or organizations will respond more favorably to a colleague of a musician they work with rather than a random musician they haven't heard of who seemingly has no connections to the group.

<b>5. Yourself! </b>

</div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature">I talk about this a lot in my Facebook live video because I think this point is super important and often overlooked. We have all heard the starving artist metaphor of a musician sitting by the phone waiting to hear from a gig offer. Of course there is a lot of work involved as a musician (practicing, emailing, networking, etc) so it is never simply just waiting blindly for a gig to appear but sometimes it can feel like that. Consider setting up your own opportunities or putting something together with friends! This can be super rewarding because you are in charge, picking the music, the venue, and running all of the details so you aren't waiting for someone else to call you or put something together. This is obviously easier said then done but there are many opportunities out there where music can fit in- that might not have been previously  considered. Think about places like cafes, a library, a gallery, or a nursing home etc. How can you add value to your community (i.e. Providing a service people need) while filling your own desire to perform? Another benefit of putting together your own opportunities is that by hiring other freelancers for gigs, they will be more likely to hire you in the future as an appreciation and thanks for you hiring them first. Remember we are all part of a network of musicians helping each other out so take advantage of this when you can.</div>
<div id="m_-2121560011886573463AppleMailSignature">Hopefully theses five points will help you on your search for more performing opportunities. There are many blogs and books out there about how to get more playing opportunities as well. Here are a couple of my favorites<em>:</em></div>

She has been a member of <a href="http://www.washingtonsquarewinds.org/">Washington Square Winds</a>, a woodwind quartet dedicated to performing and commissioning new works, since 2011. Casey recorded on Washington Square Wind’s 2014 <em>album They’re Alive</em>. She frequently performs in NYC with various groups such as Loft Opera, Chappaqua Orchestra, and the New York Opera Exchange. </strong>

<hr />

In honor of the first week of my final semester as a student at Purchase College, I would like to share my New Semester Resolutions and Challenges for 2018: <!--more-->

1. <strong>Lose the valves!</strong>

One year ago, I signed out the school’s natural horns out of curiosity more than anything.  I found the natural horn to be far more taxing than my modern horn, but it was also rewarding to play classical repertoire on the horn for which it was written.  Although I have enjoyed playing without valves, this horn is unforgiving, meaning I must go back to basics.  Foremost, intonation is challenging, particularly on half stopped or quarter stopped notes, but by using both drones and visual tuning aids, I am improving my ear for natural and modern horn.  The second main challenge of playing the natural horn is that all the work put in bending pitches drains my endurance much faster than other types of playing.  This semester I challenge myself to practice smart.  Expanding my endurance will happen gradually, so I resolve to respect my embouchure instead of imposing more time on the face because I have a practice timeframe in mind.  In the end, relearning the basics of horn playing on a natural horn should directly benefit my contemporary horn playing.

<strong> 2. Perform difficult, but rewarding works!</strong>

Years ago, I happened upon the Henri Tomasi Concerto for Horn and Orchestra and found this piece to be exciting to practice, but too intimidating to consider programming on a recital.  Much of the piece exists in the upper register with several prolonged notes at the top of my register.  It has strange leaps and arpeggios, but should be played as if it is easy.  This semester, I will perform my second Master’s recital at Purchase and although it may be prudent to choose safe pieces, I have decided to program this rarely performed gem in addition to Mozart Horn Concerto 3 on natural horn!

<strong>3. Comprehend intricate theory!</strong>

For my final semester, I challenge myself to analyze music that I had thought to be inscrutable.  To that end, I have enrolled myself into a course that teaches 20th century post tonal theory. My end-of-semester goal is to understand how selected atonal pieces are constructed, to describe at length the intricacies of works out of the Second Viennese School and to dive into the history.  Students of this course are also encouraged to use these methods to compose and perform works in class.  In the past, I would have dreaded such a test, but I have decided to take control of this final semester and embrace the difficulties and the progress.

<strong>4. Turn mock auditions into real auditions!</strong>

Occasionally, I would hear of an audition in the area, but I usually balk at the idea of taking an audition. I would make up excuses telling myself that there are surely innumerable people applying for the same job that have more prestigious resumes and renown, so why should I bother?  This semester, I challenge myself to take an audition.  I am fortunate to be in a program right now that incorporates excerpt classes and mock auditions into the curriculum.  With the wealth of resources available to me as a student, I resolve to face my fear of auditions and start taking those risks.

<strong>5. Being kind to yourself!</strong>

This is the most important resolution that I need to take to heart.  Any time spent talking myself down or thinking I’m not worthy compared to others is time that cannot be spent working toward goals. It is not helpful to derive self-worth from playing everything perfectly all the time, as it has in the past, discouraged me from reaching my potential because I assumed I would not be good enough compared to the innumerable imaginary people who are better than me.  Instead, this semester, I will practice waking up knowing I am already a worthy person just as I am, therefore I should play the horn to earn the life I want, rather than picking up the horn to scrape morsels of fleeting confidence.  I resolve this semester and beyond to be an unshakable friend to myself and welcome whatever the future holds.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About Donna Parkes</h2>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-2476" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donna-parkes.jpg" alt="donna parkes" width="261" height="392" />

<h2>Interview</h2>
<strong><span class="im">1. Tell us a little about yourself and what you do. What do you love about being an orchestral trombonist? </span></strong><!--more-->

I am Principal trombone of the Louisville Orchestra and the Colorado Music festival orchestra during the summer. I also love chamber music and teaching but my primary focus is orchestral performance. There are many parts of orchestral playing I love, it is such a unique and awesome feeling to be a part of the sound of a full symphony. To be surrounded by and contributing to music-making of that magnitude is fantastic. Another part of the orchestra I enjoy the most is the low brass section and how we function together as a team. I have fantastic colleagues in my orchestra and we are constantly striving to improve ourselves while supporting each other and that is very gratifying for me. Having players beside you that you respect and admire, then working together to have the best low brass product we can is so rewarding and fun!

<strong><span class="im">2. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</span></strong>

As female brass players I think our primary role is to be the best musicians and human beings we can. I have tried to simplify my approach and focus less on being a great female musician but rather to gain respect as a great musician and colleague. There is no doubt the role of being a woman brass player has many challenges and I believe everyone has to find their own path. It looks different for all of us but each woman should feel confident and supported to be her true self. I love that during my career I am seeing more women players and as there are more role models, that will only continue and grow. In the current climate of gender equality awareness I am encouraged that younger women will deal with less of the issues of the past. I strongly believe we need to support one another as women and be brave enough to speak up when situations are not acceptable. Our responsibility is to stand for what is right for yourself and for others every time. To strive to live the principles you believe in – for me that is being a dedicated, respectful and kind musician.

<strong>3. Tell us a little about what you do to stay motivated and focused in your job as a musician. How does this relate to your experiences running? (You’ve talked before in an <a href="https://8thposition.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/donna-parkes/2">interview with The 8th Position</a> about the physical and emotional benefits of running to you as a person and a trombone player.) Do you feel running marathons has an impact on your daily life as an orchestral musician?</strong>

I find holding myself to high standards regardless of the situation has kept me motivated and focused. I try my best to make the best sound I can and to be the most sensitive musician I can – no matter what the environment. Having standards that you expect of yourself means you’re not as affected my all the variables that come up. I love to challenge myself by mixing up my musical diet – chamber music, recitals – anything to keep me fresh and striving for new goals. There is no doubt that for me running has a huge impact on my life as a musician. Purely from a physical standpoint there are benefits, when I am in great running shape I breathe better and playing is just easier. The mental benefits are even greater – running keeps me relaxed and energized. It requires true discipline which as musicians we all have , if you don’t put in the training miles the race will not be a fun day! Distance running in particular challenges your mental grit and having that skill developed is always valuable – if you can get through the last 4 miles of a marathon and stay positive you can achieve just about anything. For me the one the great lessons from running is to run YOUR race for that day – to focus on your best efforts and appreciate that as a success. Losing the attachment to comparisons to other runners and being able to trust your training and run the best you can, for me directly relates to being the best trombonist I can every day.

<strong>4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own or when teaching?</strong>

There are challenges for the today's climate and it is continuing to change. Much greater flexibility is required and musicians need to be able to be far more proactive in their approaches. There are no guarantees especially in the orchestral world so having  a wider skill set and being open to different career paths is vital. I encourage all my students to be open minded and try to learn many parts of the musical spectrum. Today you can not wait for gigs to fall in your lap – you need to make opportunities and be excited to try new things. The benefit of this climate is there are now many more ways to have a career in music if you are prepared to put in the time and energy. If you truly love it you can find a way to make it happen.

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

It sure would have been nice to know I was going to have the opportunities I have – but the competitive nature of the orchestral world certainly motivated me. I would have given my younger self a confidence boost of assurance that time and experience has taught me. For younger musicians I would say work as hard as you can – it always pays off sometime down the line. The hours of dedication are invaluable and will give you a sense of pride and accomplishment you can’t get from anything but focused practice. The practice room is the most important place and you need to enjoy the art of the craft itself. Love what you do passionately but remember you are not your instrument – it does not define you. Success and failure are both just lessons to be taken in stride. I would encourage every young woman to find the support to be her authentic self and to speak up loudly when situations are not acceptable. Find mentors and career heroes and ask them all the questions – take in all the information you can. Be true to your principles – because at the end of the day the only opinion that truly matters is yours.

<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life, or anything else? </strong>

I have found the Bulletproof musician website to be a great resource and an area we often don’t get enough guidance or help with as a musicians. For me, hearing new players and wildly different interpretations is inspiring. I am also loving all the new great blogs and resources online – there is great information and motivation to be found!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Ways to Treat Your Instrument Right This Valentine&#039;s Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-2480" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/valentineshorn1.png" alt="valentine'shorn1" width="544" height="403" />

Okay, so maybe your instrument isn't the only figure in your life who's important to you on Valentine's Day. But maybe it is! Either way, our instruments stick with us through thick and thin and we owe them some gratitude. Show your horn you care this February 14th with a little TLC! <!--more-->
<h2>1. Brush Your Mouthpiece</h2>
How often do you actually do this? No matter how careful and clean you are with your instrument, crud will gradually build up in your mouthpiece. This buildup, in addition to being gross, muddies your tone (there are better ways to get that "dark" sound you've always wanted!). Start this Valentine's Day off right by soaking your mouthpiece in some warm water and then putting a mouthpiece brush through it.
<h2>2. Bathe Your Instrument</h2>
Is there anything more romantic than drawing a nice, lukewarm bath for your instrument? Of course not! Remember, though: the only thing "steamy" about this should be the spirit of the holiday. Hot water can strip off lacquer and damage your instrument. It is better to err on the side of caution with water temperature.

Start by laying a towel or bath mat in the bottom of your bathtub. Fill the tub high enough with lukewarm water that it will cover your instrument. Add in about a tablespoon or less of mild dish soap. Take out all your instrument's slides and wipe the oil/grease off of them. If the instrument has pistons, take those out and wipe them off too. Remove top and bottom valve caps. If your valves have felts, remove them so they don't get wet. Gently place all of the parts into the tub and let them soak for 10-15 minutes.

After it's done soaking, clean out the instrument's tubing with a snake. Go slowly and be careful not to dent your horn in this process. If your instrument has pistons, clean out the valve casings with a valve casing brush.

Once you're done snaking and brushing, rinse the horn with clean, non-soapy water with a shower head, a bathtub faucet, or a big cup. Get all excess water out, and then dry it off with a clean towel. Make sure to rinse off soap to the best of your ability; any remaining dishwashing liquid will reduce the effectiveness of grease and oil!
<h2>3. Oil Your Instrument</h2>
Once you're done cleaning your instrument, it's time to reapply all the lubricant you just washed off. Grease your tuning slides. Oil your valves (or trombone slide)! Nothing screams "Valentine's Day" quite like the smell of instrument grease on a Wednesday morning.
<h2>4. Don't Eat and Play!</h2>
I know, that box of heart-shaped chocolates is tempting. But, once again, that's not how you get a "chocolatey" tone. Think of what all of that sugary muck will do to your newly-cleaned instrument! Better to save the sweets for after you're done playing. Alternately, a good tooth-brushing before you perform will help keep your horn nice and clean.
<h2>5. Play Your Instrument</h2>
All the above maintenence habits are great, but at their core they're really just preparation for the most beautiful, romantic Valentine's Day activity of all: playing music. Take your shiny (or unlacquered), newly clean instrument out into the world on Wednesday and make some music. It makes the world a better place to be.

<hr />

Transitioning from music school to the freelance world can be incredibly intimidating. When I finished my degree, I moved to New York City hardly knowing anyone. It took a mere few hours in my new apartment to realize I felt like I had no idea what I was doing. <!--more-->

That was four years ago. Each year gets better and work has become steady, but that result has taken constant attention and evolution. Here are some questions that I seem to constantly ask myself throughout this journey.

1. <b>What is your goal?</b>

This may sound like a “duh” question, but this is something that I constantly ask myself. As my career develops I actually find that my answer changes. It’s important to have a degree of focus in your goal, but it’s also equally as important to be flexible.

You may have to journey down some avenues that might not seem so intuitive to reach your goals. For example: if your goal is to be the ultimate side-person, don’t you think it’s important to be a leader at some point to know what a good side-person looks like from a leaders perspective?

It’s also important for your goal to be an informed one. If you plan on getting into the New York Philharmonic or land a major university job right out of college, you might need to realize your goal is not a realistic one. Take a few steps back, come up with goals that act as stepping stones to achieving your dreams.

<b>2. What sets those who are successful on your envisioned career path apart from their peers? </b>

You’ll find a surprisingly wide variety of variables when you start to examine the careers of others. Though it may seem noble to; don’t limit your examination to musical ability alone. I’ve seen people thrive off of their exceptional business/interpersonal skills.

While someone like Jimmy Heath may have the career you’ve envisioned, it is equally as important to look to up and coming peers that are having success. Living legends started their career in a vastly different industry climate, it’s important to study the changes that have taken place and what is now demanded. This can mean developing a skill doubling, building a small remote recording set up, or knowing music notation software.

<b>3. What skills do you have that set you apart from your peers? If you can’t think of anything… it might be time to develop a new skill.</b>

In today’s freelance climate, it’s important to develop a variety of skills. You may be an exceptional sight reader, but if someone puts changes on your page, can you also improvise? You may be a great improviser, but can you blend in a section? Can you conduct if necessary? Are you able to compose/arrange? Teach? Experience with music technology? There are lots of people who can do one or two of these things extremely well, but the more you can do at a high level, the better. You will also find that many of these go hand in hand. Improvisation demands instrumental proficiency, advanced aural skills, compositional techniques, and rhythmic studies. It’s also worth mentioning, that jack of all trades and master of none is not what I’m talking about. Music is a marathon, not a sprint. You can’t force it. With time and effort you will begin to make connections and be able to practice several advanced things all at once.

I also include rehearsal etiquette as a “skill” which includes things like: being on time, promptly responding to emails from a bandleader, not noodling in a rehearsal or warming up super loud before a gig. One piece of advice I received that has worked very well for me is trying to call subs that are better or as good as you. It gives you a chance to call people you look up to, and also shows the band leader that your primary interest is best serving the music. If you get called for a gig and send a bad sub, the bandleader is more likely to replace you. Believe it or not: this can actually lead to contracting work.

<b>4. What am I doing to develop my musicianship? </b>

Consider that your answer should include things beyond sitting with your instrument in a practice room. Music is about telling a story, and if you don’t experience life, it’s hard to have a story to tell. It is also hard to find out how to reach an audience/effectively communicate with other musicians from inside a practice room.

A big part of developing your musicianship is going to see live music and seeing how other artist connect to you as an audience member. Seek out opportunities to hear live performances of musicians performing music that you may be unfamiliar with or even ensembles that don’t include your instrument. For me, the unfamiliarity factor of the experience helps you understand how universal music is and the powerful feelings it can evoke without excessive analysis.

Take lessons with masters of your instrument. If you are doubling, take lessons from master doublers. If you live in a place where it’s geographically hard to reach one of these people, reach out for a Skype lesson.

Want to learn how to better express yourself musically on that concerto? Learn to improvise and convey your own musical ideas. If you can convey your musical abilities through your own “words”, it will come through much better when speaking the musical ideas of someone else.

<b>5. What am I doing to actively create opportunities for myself and other musicians? </b>

In many ways, we all rely on each other. There are more opportunities to create work than just being a bandleader. It can be something as little as letting a bandleader know that you know someone who would do a great job on a certain chair if they didn’t already have someone in mind, or something as big as putting a music series together at a neighborhood restaurant, or even getting friends together to play in the subway. This shows that you have initiative, and that you care about the community enough to give back from which you reap benefits from.

You may find that this actual question becomes your goal. If you’re passionate about helping underserved communities, you can start a music series for women band leaders or black artist or gay artist, etc.

It is never too early to mentor. Though I mentioned generally trying to call people better than you, it’s also equally important to give new faces opportunities to learn and grow. Eventually those younger people will be a vital part of our workforce and will remember your generosity.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Music Lessons That Become Life Lessons</title>

<hr />

For those who have been at a crossroads in life (like I am currently, about to finish up a teaching degree), understand that it is a transitional stage when you need to figure out a number of things. While brainstorming what I might do come September, I’ve been trying to re-evaluate and formulate my goals. Since music and the arts were created to reflect and express things about life, I’ve decided to write about 5 lessons that not only apply to music, but to life as well. <!--more-->

<strong>1.</strong> <b>Breathe
</b>This is something that as brass players we know all too well - it is essential to brass playing. We practice breathing to fuel our sound, play in time, play with others, and prepare for what we’re about to play. There is nothing more serene than hearing the breath at the beginning of a piece. Players are preparing to play, and hyper focused on what they are about to create. Lately I’ve been thinking about breathing consciously not only while playing, but in everyday life. We all need a reminder sometimes to take a moment to breathe. I forget so much that I got a tattoo on my wrist that says “breathe”! Life can become so overwhelming and busy, that we often forget to take a moment to breathe and focus on what our goals are for the day, week, month, year, or lifetime. Mindful breathing can be extremely beneficial.

<strong>2. Listen</strong>
We know that this is something very obvious in music, but it’s also so important in life! We need to listen to others and listen to ourselves. How we react to that is also very important; should we blend, should we stand out, who has a solo or who is speaking, how can we support them, how can we be supported? As human beings, we want our voice to be heard. If someone is actively listening to us, we feel important. I think it’s also extremely crucial to listen to your body. I was diagnosed with celiac disease about 4 years ago now and I can say that listening to my body has helped not only my nutrition, but my intuition as well. “Trust your gut” so the saying goes. As we go through life, whether it’s on a musical path or not, listening to others and yourself will help you and your relationships flourish.

<strong>3. </strong><b>Embrace the Dissonance.
</b>I have a western, classically trained ear. When I first started at the University of Toronto in theory class, we were trying to completely avoid dissonance. But, I think it’s beneficial to sit in that discomfort and embrace it for what it is. As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I’m in a transitional phase in my life. I graduated with a Bachelor of Music in June 2017. I’m currently in teachers college, about to graduate in June 2018. I decided just over a month ago that I wanted to pursue a masters in performance. For anyone who has known me for any length in time, knows that I never saw myself as a musician capable of being a professional tuba player. My anxiety around performing was debilitating and discouraged me from the route of performance. However, in December 2017, I had an extremely eye-opening experience. I attended at Christmas concert put on by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra featuring the Canadian Brass and the whole evening was so inspiring and was a series of completely unexpected events. It was one of those nights where if I had turned left instead of right at any point in the evening, it would have turned out SO differently. My take away from this night was, in the paraphrased words of Nelson Mandela, to make choices reflecting my hopes, not my fears. I’ve decided to take risks or suffer knowing I’ve lost the chance. Not knowing if I will be teaching in Canada or anywhere in the world, attending a school for performance, attending music festivals and conferences, is all extremely unsettling- but exciting! I would much rather chase my dreams because life starts the moment you step outside of your comfort zone and into the dissonance.

<b>4. One bad note ≠ a bad player.
</b>I remember in high school always thinking that if I messed up one note, that meant I was a bad player. And now, I do still have to ask myself that - especially when thinking about auditions. Of course many things go into playing like articulation, dynamics, musicality, etc, but would one bad note keep me from getting a job? I like to think not. This also applies to life in the sense that one bad day does not equal a bad life. I don’t know how many times I have been so emotional over a bad day and thought that it would drastically affect my week. Each day is a new day. Similar to being a great musician, there are so many things that can go into having a great day. Finding the things that make you happy, confident, and grateful are paramount when finding the good things about you as a musician and in life.

<strong>5. </strong><b>Create Beauty.
</b>When I say create beauty, I don’t necessarily mean create something that sounds beautiful or looks beautiful.. But rather something that feels beautiful because it’s authentic and YOU. I’ve recently come across a term that has deeply resonated with me from the Greek language, but does not directly translate to English. However, this is the spirit of the word:

<i>Meraki - to do something with soul, creativity or love; to put something of yourself into </i><i>      your work.</i>

This is exactly what I hope to do with everything in my life. My performing, networking, schooling, teaching, cooking, creating, painting, practicing, and things I have yet to discover. This Greek term has rekindled a passion within me to create things that are authentic to me - and the result is in fact beauty. We are all unique and have so much to contribute to this world musically or otherwise. I think that ‘meraki’, or to create beauty, is truly essential for a life well lived and loved.

<hr />

<span style="font-weight:400;">I have never spoken so openly about being a public school band teacher. I just started my job in September 2017, and I’ve been pretty quiet about it. As a professional musician, at first, I felt that having a teaching job was something to be ashamed of. However, in the past six months, I’ve realized that couldn’t be further from the truth. I think it’s time for me to speak out about how fantastic my job is. So without further ado, here are five (of the many) great things about my teaching job. </span><!--more-->

<strong>1. I practice more efficiently </strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I have much less free time these days. Not only do I spend my days at school, but most evenings I devote to lesson planning. However, my limited free time has resulted in more focused and goal-oriented practice sessions. I’ve adopted a weekly “assignment log” for myself that I keep throughout the week. I give myself assignments to learn that I check off as I accomplish them throughout the week. Another tool that I use during my practice sessions is a timer. I give myself a set amount of time to achieve a single task. Most days I find that I can accomplish some goals in as little as five minutes, but sometimes things just aren’t going right and then the best thing to do is leave it for another day. By practicing this way, I do not waste my chops or time on one task. </span>

<strong>2. I’m a better listener </strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Not only has my musical ear developed immensely since beginning my teaching job, but my ability to communicate with many different people has also improved. During band rehearsals, my ear is much more sensitive to what is happening. I am much quicker at identifying when a specific instrument section is lost or when students play wrong notes. These skills then translate to my gigs and make me a better musician. When I'm on a gig, I’m listening for intonation much more closely. I’m working to match the players around me. I’m also looking for the conductor’s feedback and working to create better the vision they have in their head because when I'm the conductor that’s precisely what I’m asking of my students. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">   </span><span style="font-weight:400;"> I have also improved my ability to communicate with other people. As a teacher I have to I have to balance relationships with my students, their parents, the other music teachers, the rest of the faculty, the custodial staff, and the administrators. At the beginning of this year, I was timid about communicating with all of these people. As the year has gone on, I feel much more comfortable with my communication skills. The new capabilities I've developed translate directly to gigs. I'm less shy around other musicians, and I feel more confident in holding a conversation. </span>

<strong>3. My students bring me out of my shell</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I’m a shy and introverted person by nature. In fact, most people are shocked when they find out that I play the trumpet because it’s such a loud instrument and I’m such a quiet person. The first month of school my voice was so tired from talking all the time, but now I speak louder and with more confidence in my classroom.  </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I’ve learned that students need animation and enthusiasm from a teacher. It helps keep them focused, engaged, and excited about the music. I’ve been pushing myself to be more animated when praising my students as well as to be more open to joking around and laughing at my mistakes. I’m more passionate about encouraging my students to give 100% of their effort in my class, and I’m also more open with my students when they are not putting forth as much energy as they are capable of giving. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Opening myself up to my students has improved my musicianship because I’m starting to care just a little bit less about what other people think about me but in the best possible way. I’m slowly shedding my self-consciousness and beginning to embrace my confidence when I play the trumpet at gigs. Don’t let me fool you, I’m still always working on this every single day, but being in the classroom with my students has helped me take the first few baby steps.</span>

<strong>4. Change is slow and that’s ok</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I’m working on decluttering my classroom and getting it set up just the way I want it. I’m trying my hardest to get my students to come to group lessons. I’m working on getting new technology into my classroom. I want to create a system for borrowing school instruments. I’m working on practice log and incentive systems for younger students. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">    </span> <span style="font-weight:400;">These are just a few of the many ideas that I’m working on incorporating into my classroom and in my teaching. Some days I am completely overwhelmed by all of the changes that I want to happen. On those days my awesome coworker reminds me to do one micro-task at a time, and eventually, it’ll get done. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">  </span> <span style="font-weight:400;"> I always expected to get better at the trumpet RIGHT NOW. It took me getting a teaching job to realize that change is a slow process, and that’s ok. Making improvements to my trumpet playing is just like creating the "perfect" band program. Both are going to take time, patience, and many micro-tasks, but I'm willing to put in the time and effort to make it happen. </span>

<strong>5. I’m still a professional musician</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Just because I’m a band teacher doesn’t mean I’m stripped of the title of “musician,” in fact, I feel like more of a musician now that I did before my teaching job. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I’m gigging more regularly, and I’ve made many new connections to people through my teaching job. I’ve met some excellent instrument repair technicians, private teachers, and musician parents. All of these connections just add to my growing network. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"> I also feel much more like a musician because of all the skills I’ve gained through teaching like improving my musical ear; I’m listening to more music than I ever have, and as a conductor I’m thinking about music in a whole new way. Finally, I’m re-discovering my passion for playing music through teaching music. My students will be the first ones to tell you how excited I get about music and I’ve never been more happy with where I am.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited today to share a guest post by Alyssa Wells about her path from playing trombone and baritone in bands to pursuing a PhD in Musicology. Thank you, Alyssa, for sharing your story!

<img class="wp-image-2524 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wells-headshot.jpg" alt="Wells - Headshot.jpg" width="249" height="249" /><em>Alyssa Wells is a Musicology PhD student and Rackham Merit Fellow at the University of Michigan. Her research interests include: labor union and industry bands, protest music, the politics of sound and space, and communist and socialist composers. </em><em>Before coming to the University of Michigan, she completed master's degrees at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Musicology (M.M.) and German and Scandinavian Studies (M.A.). While at UMass, her research on Hanns Eisler and music festivals in the German Democratic Republic received funding from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). Alyssa also holds a B.A. in Music (trombone) and German Studies from Western Michigan University. In her free time, she enjoys running, cooking, telling terrible jokes, and making annoying puns.</em>

<hr />

If you would have told 19-year-old me that I am now just about halfway done with a PhD in musicology, I would have probably laughed…
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2517" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig1.png" alt="Fig1" width="627" height="239" />
Figure 1 - Alyssa, aged 19. Clearly enthused about musicology</p>
…In fact, until the past year, musicology had never truly felt “natural” to me. The field was intriguing and inspiring enough to decide to devote my life to it, but what I studied simply did not furnish me with the same deep personal connection that I consistently witnessed my colleagues experiencing. <!--more-->

I found temporary refuge in studying composers who engaged in musical endeavors that I viewed as valuable. I had grown up in a nonmusical family, in a community that had little access to professional music making—a fact that became acutely apparent to me as I realized that almost all my peers at Western Michigan University had received professional lessons prior to beginning their bachelor’s degrees. While working on my master’s degrees at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I was led to the communist composer Hanns Eisler and the circles in which he traveled. I admired their efforts to make music accessible to all by providing public opportunities for music education. I couldn’t help but think that if my parents had received the type of education that Eisler and his colleagues were attempting to implement, they would not have mistakenly bought me a hat that says “TRUMPET” (I play trombone…) or taken countless pictures of a random girl with a mellophone when I marched in drum and bugle corps (I played baritone…).

Studying like-minded individuals who seemed to be working toward preventing similarly endearing mistakes sustained me for some time. Yet, I would get the nagging feeling that something was not quite right every time a colleague would chatter away excitedly about a piece or performance studying. What was driving my complete apathy towards the music to which I was devoting my life? By my second year at the University of Michigan, I began to see that the path I was on was not sustainable. I needed to find something that I could throw myself into on a more permanent basis, so I decided that if I could figure out what had led me to be in this position in the first place, perhaps I could combine these formative experiences into something I could use as a dissertation topic. What follows is a much more organized (and significantly less angsty) depiction of my academic soul searching, accompanied by my conclusions, or “dissertation essentials.”

I quickly realized that my educational path had been driven by my love for brass instruments and music education. I began to play trombone as a middle school student, having chosen the instrument because it had “less buttons” than my nemesis, the piano. (By the time I would finish my bachelor’s degree, I would learn that this sentiment seems to reflect the personality of most trombone players rather accurately.) I was truly a band nerd in high school, rarely having more fun and being more invested in music than during marching band. Because of this, I ended up marching drum and bugle corps for five years with the Glassmen and Carolina Crown and grew addicted to the enjoyment and excitement people could gain through music.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2518 aligncenter" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig2.jpg" alt="Fig2" width="389" height="519" />Figure 2 - Alyssa (left) performing with Carolina Crown (2009)</p>
By the time I began college I was hooked. I knew I wanted to be involved in music for the rest of my life. Reflecting on what initially ignited my passion for my music helped me articulate two of my “dissertation essentials:”
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Dissertation essential #1: The music I study should be exciting and enjoyable. </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Dissertation essential #2: Band.</strong></p>
I began my time at Western Michigan University on the wait-list to join the trombone studio and become a music education major. By the time I became a member of the studio in my second semester, I realized that I would be financially unable to be a music education major because, when compounded with my interest in a German degree, it would require a fifth year of me. Nevertheless, my always supportive trombone professor, Steve Wolfinbarger, continued to push me to be the best trombonist I could be while I pursued a dual Bachelor of Arts degree in music and German studies.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2519" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig3.jpg" alt="Fig3" width="588" height="441" />
Figure 3 - Dr. Wolfinbarger expressing why Alyssa wasn’t a performance major (2012)</p>
His passion for pedagogy and genuine concern and investment in his students was essential to my completion of the degree. Additionally, the performances and presence of the incredibly talented professor of tuba and euphonium Deanna Swoboda, not to mention the continued international success of my female studio-mates, provided a strong antidote to the sexist environment of drum corps that I experienced every summer.

<strong>Dissertation essential #3: Pedagogy and education are important to me.</strong>

<strong>            Dissertation essential #4: Women are musicians, too. </strong>

For two and a half years, I floated through school, taking the required German and music courses. I had no real plan but thought that I could figure things out.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2520" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig4.jpg" alt="Fig4" width="559" height="419" />
Figure 4 - Alyssa enjoying German things in Vienna (2010)</p>
By the end of my junior year at WMU, I discovered that there was a field where I could write about music <em>and</em> German literature: musicology. Thrilled by the idea that I could perhaps do something with my life, I pursued musicology as a career.

<strong>            Dissertation essential #5: I like German things. </strong>

I began a master’s degree in musicology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My first year was apparently too easy, as I began a second degree during my second year and would graduate in my third year with an additional master’s degree in German and Scandinavian Studies. I believe that I survived my first years of graduate school thanks to my time in drum corps.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2521" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig5.jpg" alt="Fig5" width="608" height="406" />
Figure 5 - Alyssa and her family on graduation day in Amherst (2015)</p>
While in high school, drum corps fueled my passion for music and while I was at WMU, it provided me with a distraction from the woes of being an undergraduate. By the time I reached graduate school, I realized that it had also taught me to work hard, fight through adversity, and take criticism well. An outcome of my time marching that resulted from the unfortunate reality of sexism in the activity was that I also had grown to feel as if I constantly needed to prove myself—in the context of DCI this was largely because I was often one of the only women in the section. Translated to graduate school, this pushed me to overachieve, but this time in a slightly less sexist context.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Dissertation essential #6: Don’t give up. Finish this dissertation. Just. Keep. Going. </strong></p>
One of the most fortunate events during my existential-crisis-turned-self-evaluation was working toward my ethnomusicology minor as a part of my musicology PhD. I saw a chance to pursue a topic that had seemed to be forbidden by musicology: marching band and drum and bugle corps. One thing led to another and I was given the opportunity to do research with drum corps in Japan and the Netherlands through the Center for World Performance Studies, exploring what the activity means to individuals and how it fits into their lives.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-2522 aligncenter" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fig6.jpg" alt="Fig6" width="611" height="407" />Figure 6 - Alyssa with the Tokushima Indigoes Drum &amp; Bugle Corps (2017)</p>
I ultimately learned that drum corps and marching band still has a hold on my own life. Together with the work I was doing on music festivals in East Germany, I almost felt like I had something sustainable. Every item on my “dissertation essentials” list would be satisfied, even if it meant perpetuating musicology’s problem of excluding the study of wind and brass bands and the marching arts. But being a self-proclaimed over-achiever, I of course needed to expand on my list.

<strong>Dissertation essential #7: Sticking to the dissertation essentials is fulfilling.</strong>

I hit my lucky break while doing some background research for a final paper. I came across photographs of marching bands that accompanied labor unions during parades and protests in the United States between the two World Wars. I began to ask: Who were these people? Where did they learn their instruments? What music did they play? Did they accompany the labor union choirs that have been researched so extensively? I came to the realization that just because wind bands and marching ensembles do not occupy a prominent position in the musicological canon did not mean that I had to ignore the subject all together. Perhaps most importantly, the heavy involvement of German communist émigrés in labor unions and workers’ movements. I realized that pursuing this subject meant that I could make use of <em>all </em>of the dissertation essentials I had outlined.

In exploring the topic further, I came to realize that my extensive first-hand experience as a female baritone and trombone player in marching ensembles has given me the insights to ask questions that have not been extensively researched. For example, I am particularly aware of the physical body and the space that it occupies. Although a drum corps and marching band can motivate a sense of unity between the individual and the ensemble, the scarcity of women within the brass section meant that this unity would never be complete; jokes and sexist comments ran rampant and casting decisions were heavily influenced by gender rather than ability. This leads me to question how individuals felt their place in the wind ensembles and marching bands that were a part of labor union music making. These questions lead me to even larger avenues for investigation that relate to the politics of performing in public, how visible identities form meaning, and how the sound of a marching band can compel bodies to act.

In turning to my past, I learned that it is possible for me to feel the same fulfillment as my colleagues with my own research. Instead of being discouraged by the lack of scholarship in musicology about wind or brass bands, I have grown encouraged. I do not need to turn to orchestral or operatic music, I can study the music with which I have personal experience. I do not need to focus on music that people paid to see, I can instead learn about music that was blasted on the streets for all to hear. I do not need to eliminate my passion for education and pedagogy, I can ask how other people learned music. I can use my research to explore how others who were uprooted from the places and music with which they are most comfortable learned to adapt and redirect their passion while continuing to help others. Without the sum of my experiences informed by the trombone and baritone, I would not have found this passion for research that has been ignited within me.

<strong>Audrey Flores is a freelancing horn player in New York City. She attended the Juilliard School and the Mannes College of Music, and regularly plays in Broadway productions and with orchestras in the tri-state area. She plays a 2007 Engelbert Schmid Triple Horn with a medium hand-hammered bell that was also made in 2007, purchased brand new from The Horn Guys in Los Angeles in 2008.</strong>

<b>Formerly Principal Horn of both the Allentown Symphony and Symphony in C in Camden, NJ, Audrey has also played with the New World Symphony, the Columbus Symphony Orchestra in Ohio, the Miami Symphony Orchestra, the New Jersey Festival Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Mariinsky Orchestra, and the Orpheus Chamber Ensemble. She was a musician in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular Orchestra in 2011 and 2012, and in the New York Spectacular in the summer of 2016. She released her first solo album in June of 2017.</b>

Ever have those days where you leave your apartment as the sun comes up, and get home when the stars are long gone? Days like this can be hard on your health, and harder still if you end up starving and spending your hard-earned cash on overpriced food before you’ve even gotten paid. Here are Five Things To Bring and Eat on a long day. Eat well and don’t forget your toothbrush!<!--more-->

<strong>1. Thick soups and stews:</strong> So easy: put some chopped veggies, proteins of your choice (tofu is great for this!), rice or pasta if you want, and zap it with a spice blend like my sacred Adobo or even a leftover ramen packet. Cover it all just to the top with liquid and cook it down on a medium heat. I like to have it thick so it’s easy to eat on the train, or even as I’m walking. It yields at least 10 servings, so I pop one in a takeout container with a plastic spoon and I’m good.

<strong>2. Tacos and wraps:</strong> One of the first things my husband said after meeting my family was “wow you guys eat a LOT of tacos.” Leftovers, lunch meat, even the remainders of your thick stew can go into a corn tortilla or, if you’re watching your waist like I am, a romaine lettuce leaf. Just bring the filling and wraps along separately and put them together when it’s time to eat, so they don’t get soggy like a sad sandwich that gets tossed around and mangled.

<strong>3. Protein Packs:</strong> We’ve all been super hungry and run into a pharmacy or certain coffeehouse, and we leave $10 poorer for a couple of almonds, cheese, and hard-boiled eggs. Put these together the night before your long day and throw ‘em in the expensive case you’re still paying off! I may or may not customize mine with a piece of fancy/junky chocolate.

<strong>4. Fresh fruits and veggies: </strong>Always have an apple, orange, or chopped veggies you can eat between jobs. Peanut butter for dipping is a nice add-on, but not necessary.

<strong>5. Water Bottle and instant coffee packets:</strong> There are some individually-sized instant coffee brands out there that are great, and you can drink them cold or hot. It saves a ton of money in the long run, which leaves a budget for those end of the long day drinks with your friends.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Pieces for Horn by Five Living Women Composers that I performed this week - Bailey Myers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2555" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_8987.jpg" alt="IMG_8987" width="5184" height="3456" />
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hornist Bailey Myers is a Washington DC-based artist and activist, performing all types of music as often as possible and working to empower women in the music industry. Since moving to the Baltimore/Washington area in 2016, Bailey has performed with the Peabody Symphony Orchestra, the National Orchestral Institute Festival Orchestra, the Washington Chamber Orchestra, and the Baltimore-based Occasional Symphony. As a soloist and chamber musician, Bailey is passionate about featuring works by women composers and has performed at many events and churches in the area. Bailey has recently been named the new music director of Ascension Episcopal Church in Silver Spring, MD where she will be expanding a public concert series as one of her duties, and she is excited to use this platform to give more exposure to women composers and musicians (especially brass musicians!).</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bailey Myers currently studies with Denise Tryon at Peabody Conservatory and anticipates graduating with her Master’s Degree in Horn Performance in May 2018. She received her Bachelor of Music in Horn Performance from Oberlin Conservatory in 2016 under the instruction of Roland Pandolfi. In addition to her musical studies, Bailey also received a Bachelor of Arts in East Asian Studies from Oberlin College with a Chinese Studies concentration and a Politics minor.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

<hr />
<p dir="ltr">This past Tuesday I had my Master’s Recital, which featured all works by living women composers. It was the second recital of all women composers that I had programmed (the first featured Jane Vignery, Thea Musgrave, Clara Schumann, and Beyoncé), so it was an exciting challenge to find another hour of music. I owe so much to Lin Foulk and her awesome <a href="http://www.linfoulk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database</a>, which I highly recommend as the first place to start for any horn players looking for music written by women - solo or chamber music. The following five pieces were what I ultimately chose to program, and I am very happy with the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Imaginings by Dorothy Gates:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b>This piece is perfect for opening a recital; it has a dramatic opening and a flashy ending, while not being terribly difficult to put together with piano. Composed for Michelle Baker, recently retired 2nd horn of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, it features the low register in particular. Baker premiered Imaginings just this past summer at the 25th International Women’s Brass Conference, and you can hear her SoundCloud recording on Dorothy Gates’ website <a href="http://www.dorothygates.com/shop-pages/sheet-music/product=imaginings-horn-in-f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Dorothy Gates is definitely a composer to check out if you’re a brass player - she is a prolific composer of brass music, especially brass band music, and she is a trombonist herself. Born in Northern Ireland, she now resides in the United States where she is Senior Music Producer for The Salvation Army's Eastern Territory in New York and the Composer-in-Residence for the New York Staff Band - a position she has held since 2002. She is the first woman to be employed by The Salvation Army in this role. You can learn more about her <a href="http://www.dorothygates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Sonata for Horn and Piano by Edith Borroff:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This sonata is a fun piece that doesn’t seem to get played as much as it deserves! There is only one recording of it (on Cynthia Carr’s CD “Images”), and it took me several interlibrary loan requests to track it down. Borroff wrote this piece in 1954 and it was premiered by Nancy Becknell at Northwestern University in 1955, with Borroff herself playing the piano accompaniment. The four contrasting movements - Rhapsody, Scherzo, Sarabande, and Estampie - go backwards in time through different musical periods. The Rhapsody is Romantic and full of expression, the Scherzo is energetic and Baroque/Classical, the Sarabande is a beautiful Renaissance melody, and the Estampie is a joyous Medieval romp. Born in 1925, Edith Borroff is retired now, but she had a long and notable career as a composer, musicologist, professor, and organist. You can check out a 2011 interview with her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6rJ5Uux588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Soliloque No. 1 from Deux Soliloques by Édith Lejet:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This piece is the most “contemporary-sounding” on the program. It is unaccompanied and the score is written in proportional notation, meaning that instead of traditional measures, barlines, and time signatures, the timing/rhythm is determined by the visual horizontal spacing of the notes on the page. Lejet also includes a key and extensive written instructions (all in French) to help the performer understand her musical language. I couldn’t find any recordings of this piece, so I relied entirely on the composer’s notes and Google Translate to inform my performance (which was an experience I recommend to all musicians - it’s great to learn from your favorite performers’ recordings, but sometimes you should challenge yourself to interpret a piece entirely on your own!). Édith Lejet is a cutting-edge French composer and music educator. This piece was commissioned by the French Ministry of Culture and was the exam piece for the Paris Conservatory class of 1993. You can learn more about Édith Lejet <a href="http://www.edith-lejet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. River Melos by Andrea Clearfield:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">River Melos was commissioned by Denise Tryon (my teacher!) in 2014 as part of her ongoing project to create more repertoire featuring the low horn. This was my favorite piece on the recital, mostly because I have been working very hard on my low horn playing for the past year and a half and I was so excited to finally be able to perform something like this. It also just sounds really cool! Andrea Clearfield took inspiration for this piece from the Roaring Fork River in Aspen, Colorado, where she spent many summers as a music festival student. The melody of this piece winds its way through smooth and rocky places, changing in energy as the water rushes over rapids and ripples through deep pools. This is a true duo for horn and piano, and while the writing is incredibly complex and challenging, it is so worth the effort. River Melos has also has been arranged for trombone by Clearfield for trombonist Ava Ordman! Check out the piece and Tryon’s/Ordman’s recordings on Clearfield’s page <a href="http://www.andreaclearfield.com/works/chamber/river-melos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Frost Cycle by Lydia Lowery Busler:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This final piece on the program is a collection of four Robert Frost poems set to music as a duet for horn and mezzo-soprano with piano accompaniment. The four movements/poems - Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, My November Guest, October, and To the Thawing Wind - are a nice set, full of beautiful melodies and bright, energetic sections for contrast. This was such an enjoyable piece to perform and a nice addition to the repertoire for horn and voice. Lydia Lowery Busler is a horn player, composer, and improvisationalist, and Frost Cycle was one of her earlier works, written in 1997. You can hear a recording of Busler performing this piece on her webpage <a href="http://www.lydialowerybusler.com/listendownload-lydias-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<strong>1. How long have you been teaching? What are your responsibilities at the school? What do you love about teaching? Any favorite teaching moments?</strong>

This is currently my 5th year of  teaching. I did 2 years in Paterson, NJ Teaching k-8 general Music and marching band, 1 year in Clifton NJ teaching 7th and 8th grade band and assisting on the High School Marching band and this is my second year running a full high school program. I currently run the concert band, jazz band, marching band, pit Orchestra, and small chamber ensembles at Manchester Township High School. What I love most about teaching s giving kids a safe place to be where they are loved and accepted by all, and a place where they can express themselves. My students are a family and they all take care of each other. We also get to make great music and I love seeing them improve through the years. It’s the most rewarding thing to see a student change and develop as a person and as a musician. There are moments when my band nails a piece or nails a run of their field show and my heart is so full that I can’t imagine being anywhere else.<!--more-->

<strong> 2. </strong><strong>In all your years of teaching and situations interacting with students, I am sure you have faced some difficult situations. Can you think of a tough moment you have had as a teacher and how it shapes your experience today?</strong>

When I worked in Clifton, the situation was really difficult because I was hired as a year long replacement when they moved the middle school director up to the high school after having to remove the high school director. I was verbally promised that I would stay if I did a great job, but they ended up pushing the teacher back down to the middle school, hiring someone new at the high school, and pushing me out. Telling my 7th and 8th graders that I was leaving was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I was so attached to them and they were so attached to me that I thought I would never recover from leaving them. I ended up landing my dream job after that and I love where I am, so I learned that everything truly happens for a reason, even if you can’t see the reason right away.

<strong>3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

I do think we have an important job as female brass players. There have been many times I have sat down in a section to play first or play lead, and all of the grey haired men next to me look at me with doubt or anger that I can do it. I think that’s ridiculous how often that happens and I am proud to say that currently all but one of my brass players in my high school  band are female.

<strong> 4. </strong><strong>Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?</strong>

I think there are lots of challenges, especially in schools. The arts are under appreciated and under funded. This is not purely a high school problem, but one we deal with very often. I tell my students that as long as they feel good about what they are doing when they perform, it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, and I try to hold that example for myself as well.

<strong> 5. </strong><strong>Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

I wish I had known that you really have to be confident and not doubt yourself as a player. I try to instill in my kids that if you make a mistake while playing, make it big. That’s the only way you learn. When in doubt, play out. Being shy about it isn’t going to help you, especially as a brass player. I tell them all the time that I can’t fix mistakes I don’t hear.

<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.</strong>

Two books actually completely changed me as a player. <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Music-Barry-Green/dp/0385231261">The Inner Game of Music</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soprano-Her-Head-Right-Side-Up-Performances/dp/0911226214/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521253062&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+soprano+on+her+head+by+eloise+ristad">A Soprano on her Head</a>. </i>Those books teach you everything you’ll ever need to know about judging what comes out of your horn before it comes out of your horn. They helped me with my performance anxiety in college more than anything else.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Brass Chicks is a blog written for, by and about female brass musicians celebrating the work of the women in our community. We are currently seeking guest post submissions in two formats: <strong>“Five Things Friday”</strong> and free-form <strong>narrative</strong>. We have published over 30 guest posts so far from women of all ages and experience levels; from students to professionals.

The two formats function differently, and which format you choose will vary depending on what you want to say and how much you want to write:
<ul>
	<li><strong>“Five Things Friday”</strong> posts include a list of five items, each with a description or an explanation, which belong to a single category or theme. Recent posts have covered topics such as practice methodology, entrepreneurship, performance psychology, book recommendations, yoga poses for releasing tension, and food recommendations for busy musicians. Five Things Friday is a great way to share your ideas with a large audience in a concise, easy-to-write format.</li>
	<li><strong>Narrative</strong> posts are more flexible in format (1,000–2,000 words), better suited to longer stories or extended discussion. A published narrative post will be a unique story, testimony, or report from the perspective of its author. These posts provide a space for women to share their experiences and perspectives with the larger community in a freer-form manner.</li>
</ul>
We are especially interested in publishing material written by women which is engaging, creative, informative, and factually accurate, and which aligns with our mission of supporting women in the brass community. We believe in the power of community, of feminist storytelling, and, most of all, of music. We look forward to reading what you have to say; your voice and lived experience are what make our work worthwhile!

These guidelines are also available in a handy PDF format here:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>We are excited to feature a post by sixteen-year-old trumpet player Evelyn Hartman on Brass Chicks! Evelyn is our youngest #FiveThingsFriday writer yet but her words pack some serious wisdom. </em>

<hr />

<strong><img class=" wp-image-2577 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/evelyn.jpeg?w=1620" alt="evelyn.jpeg" width="252" height="381" /></strong>Evelyn Hartman is a sixteen-year-old trumpet player living in Northern Michigan, where she is currently a junior at Petoskey High School. She is involved in her school’s award-winning marching band, wind ensemble, and jazz band. Evelyn is also in the Northern Michigan Brass Band, having now played repiano cornet, soprano cornet, and flugelhorn parts in various programs. Another group Evelyn is involved in is the Northern Symphonic Winds. Both Northern Michigan Brass Band and Northern Symphonic Winds are often exclusive from high school players.

Evelyn has participated in several Solo and Ensemble performances. In her sophomore year, she received first division ratings at both the District and the State level for the Arutunian Concerto. This year she performed the piece Rustiques, by Eugene Bozza, again earning first division ratings at Districts and States.

Evelyn also enjoys playing for charity. This last holiday season, for example, she formed a brass ensemble that went around to local retirement homes playing a large selection of Christmas carols. In the summer of her sophomore year, Evelyn attended Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp on a merit scholarship and sat first chair in their top wind ensemble. She also earned the Outstanding Camper Award at the end of the session. For this summer, Evelyn was selected as an alternate for National Youth Orchestra 2 and was also accepted into Interlochen Arts Camp’s six-week World Youth Wind Symphony program. She recently confirmed enrollment into Interlochen’s program and is eager for it to begin.

<span style="font-weight:400;">Performances are a time of magic. Whether it is in a small room for a panel of judges or before a filled concert hall, performing allows us to share our art with others. For me personally, performing used to be a time of incredibly high stress. I found myself nervous days before it was time to showcase.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> As a result of this, my performances usually just weren’t that great; I merely survived.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> And I know I’m not the only one who has suffered from this pressure. I’ve seen many performers, from all ranges of ability, suffer symptoms of performance anxiety. Stars like Jim Carrey, Adele, and even Fryderyk Chopin have admitted that stage fright has been an issue for them.
</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400;">Performance anxiety is a massive beast. It can strike a musician in a multitude of ways. There have been times when nerves have caused me to become overly aware of what I was doing and there have been times where I have ended with no recollection of anything that I just did. I realized the way I approached performances was never going to serve me well in the long run. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">After realizing this</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, I’ve worked to strategize finding inner balance for whenever I’m about to take the stage. It’s essential in a successful performance to be able to be focused, yet calm. The saying “heart on fire, mind on ice,” introduced to me through my high school band program, will forever ring true. They were the words that were echoed by our director every time we were about to take the stage. Through hearing the words, I came to realize that it is critical to take control of your emotions prior to playing the first note. Negative and distracted thoughts have to be deflected. In the end, whenever you perform it should be only you, your burning passion, and your mind, serving as the gatekeeper between you and the audience.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Performances are a time of sharing and growth. One is able to share with the outside and grow through the inside. Performing should be a time of closure. Over the past couple of years, I’ve learned it’s essential to keep positivity close to the surface. I’ve compiled a collection of thoughts that I now run through every time I’m about to perform. I encourage you to use my list, or to better yet, use it as inspiration to make your own and think through it each time you enter a warm-up room. I’ve found mentally warming up is just as important as playing any long tone or lip slur. By going through a mental checklist, your performances can tremendously improve, as mine have, in both the delivery of the music you play and your overall feeling in the process of it all. Being properly mentally engaged when performing makes all much more meaningful.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Here are Five Things to Remind Yourself Before You Perform:</span>

<b>1. I am the best.</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Although it is important to remain humble, it is equally important to validate oneself. The music industry is filled with comparison. Comparison can be a good thing, but it can also spur lots of negativity. It is often forgotten that music is an imperfect art. We often compile strengths other players or ensembles have into one being and expect that we can come close to that if we do all of the right things. Doing this couldn’t be more unrealistic. Compare the trumpet players Wynton Marsalis and Tine Thing Helseth. Wynton is known for being a technical machine and Tine is known for being able to produce a full, effortless sound. Both players have been rated as top-notch, but both players are completely different from one another. There is no mold that you are designed to fit. In fact, it is your polished differences that will attract an audience. There have been many times when I have let myself believe that I am less than what I have worked towards. Whenever I lose sight of who I have worked to be, everything crumples. By telling yourself that you’re the best, you are putting yourself above the negative comparison that the music industry too often bears.</span>

<b>2. I am prepared.</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Music takes an excruciating amount of work. This work involves a combination of dedication and persistence. Hours are put towards rehearsing materials that only amount to a couple of minutes. It often takes many tedious practice sessions to be able to play a piece well. Music is demanding because there are so many technical aspects that must be followed. There are dynamics, articulation, and the list only continues. And one not only has to follow the instructions written in by the composer, but also translate it into something human. Music has to be played with passion. It drives me crazy when I have parts that aren’t being play up to standard, and so I get to work. I have been working from the moment that I held my instrument for the first time. The work is necessary, but the results are so very rewarding. Being able to play through a passage without thought is one of the greatest feelings one can muster. When you are about to perform, the biggest mistake you can make is letting yourself forget of all that you do.</span>

<b>3. Music is exciting.</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">There is an excitement music brings that is unable to be described. Music manipulates emotion to no end. There have been countless times where I’ve heard something that spreads a grin across my face, or where chills are moved through my entire body. Music, when played well, keeps everyone on the edge. It should grab the entire focus of those who are listening, and those who are playing. When I play, I remind myself of this. It is not my best performance unless I am fully invested into what is being done. Your emotions should be fully engaged with all that you play. If they aren’t, why play in the first place?</span>

<b>4. Playing is fun.</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Playing in itself is something that is addictive. Between the building of satisfying dexterity in the fingers and the creation of pure sound, who wouldn’t feel enjoyment when they are able to make music? When I’m playing, I’m not only close with music, but I am the music. It’s important to remind yourself that when you perform in front of an audience, you’re making music, the same as always. The only difference in performing versus practicing is that now other people get to watch you enjoy yourself and share in the pleasure of all that music is.</span>

<b>5. Every performance is only another opportunity.</b>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Performances are solely life experiences. They will never define you. If one goes wrong, all you can do is move on from it. If anything, use any bad performance as motivation for your next one, aiming for it to be better. Life becomes boring when all is easy and everything just works out. Life is a rollercoaster and the most successful partakers are the adrenaline junkies. Appreciating the bad is just as necessary as appreciating the good. Both good and bad are equal parts of being alive.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When you are about to perform, don’t consider failure in the slightest. You are the best, don’t you remember? You are prepared. Let the music be what it is meant to be; let the music excite you. Enjoy yourself and all that you are able to do with ease. Through being cool and collected, you’ll likely have good results. By overcoming failures with hard work, you are given the satisfaction you need to refuel your tank. You’ve already driven across the bumpy roads. Performing is a stop at the gas station. Regardless of whether you have a nice conversation with the person behind the counter, your tank is refilled. You are either given new motivation from the bad, or hopefully, a feeling of euphoria from the good. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2580" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dsc_3893-edit1.jpg?w=350" alt="DSC_3893-Edit1.jpg" width="280" height="420" /></strong>Performer and pedagogue <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/cmda/music/people/faculty/beloglavec.php">Hana Beloglavec </a>has always had an interest in chamber music. Currently she is a member of <a href="http://www.seraphbrass.com/">Seraph Brass</a>, a dynamic chamber ensemble drawing from a roster of highly talented women across the United States. With Seraph Brass, Beloglavec has recorded an album, Asteria, and has been a guest artist at the Lieksa Brass Week and the International Women's Brass Festival. Also interested in trombone quartet chamber music, she competed in the finals of the 2014 International Trombone Quartet Competition with the Lakeside Quartet. She also was a member of The Handsome Dan’s Trombone Quartet, which won the 2013 Eastern Trombone Workshop’s Trombone Quartet Competition as well as the 2013 Yale Woolsey Concerto Competition.

Also deeply interested in orchestral music, Beloglavec has performed as a substitute trombonist most recently with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra and the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra. While living in Chicago, Beloglavec performed as a substitute with the early-music ensemble Music of the Baroque and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Hana Beloglavec received her DMA from Northwestern University, where she studied with Michael Mulcahy, Douglas Wright, Timothy Higgins, Randall Hawes, and Christopher Davis. She completed her MM at Yale University and her BM degree at Western Michigan University, where she studied with Scott Hartman and Steve Wolfinbarger, respectively. Hana Beloglavec is currently the assistant professor of trombone at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

<strong>1.  How long have you been teaching? What are your responsibilities at the school? What do you love about teaching? Any favorite teaching moments?</strong>

I have been teaching private lessons for a long time (since I was an undergraduate student, maybe even earlier), but I have been teaching at the university level for the past three years. At LSU, I teach applied tenor and bass trombone students, trombone studio class, and trombone choir. I also coach brass quintets and teach the trombone portion of a brass pedagogy class for performance majors and masters students. Outside of my teaching, I serve on committees and recruit students, and I have my “research,” which includes performances with Seraph Brass, personal solo recitals, orchestral performances, etc. <!--more-->

I really love when a student turns something around and “gets” a concept and/or starts to make improvement in an aspect of their playing or musicianship that has previously not worked. Favorite teaching moments: when my students learn to love using their metronomes as much as I do!

<strong>2. What is it like to be a part of Seraph Brass, a touring ensemble that presents concerts and teaches masterclasses?  Tell us about your experience. Do you have anything exciting coming up with the group or on your own?</strong>

Seraph Brass is a really interesting group to be a part of. I have learned a lot about how chamber groups work. It is crazy how much work goes into booking concerts, booking flights, figuring out hotels – Mary Bowden does an amazing job! One of my favorite parts of the group is playing a concert for many different audiences – you never know how an audience will react or what they will enjoy night to night, and it is fun feeding off of their energy – plus, I will never forget an audience member who used binoculars in the front row – you do you, lady!

Coming up this summer, we are going back to Lieksa Brass Week. I am very excited - Finland was amazing last summer and I’m really looking forward to going back. There is a restaurant in Lieksa called Pizza Master that is totally calling my name! Aside from the food – I am also looking forward to sauna-ing again, and playing a concert in a “mine lagoon.”

<strong>3. Do you think we have a specific role or responsibility as female brass players? How do you incorporate that (or not) into your own life as a musician?</strong>

As a brass player, perhaps not. My job as a brass player is to create the best music I can – I don’t feel that I need to make statements about being a woman in the brass world during concerts. As long as I play with integrity and quality, that is enough to show that female brass players are just as good. I feel that my responsibility is heavier as a female university professor. I have contact with many students during a time of their lives where they are becoming adults and figuring out their own values – I try to guide students toward being their best selves, and have no qualms speaking up if I hear something that is not right toward women (or anyone for that matter).

<strong>4. Do you see any specific challenges for musicians in today’s climate? How do you mitigate those on your own and for your students?</strong>

I think it’s tough to work for your true value right now. Many people ask students to play for free or “experience,” and I try to make sure that students evaluate if a free gig is worth it to them. This is our livelihood and we need to defend it, but at the same time many people don’t understand that, and it’s important to have open communication with others. You can’t always get what you want, but you definitely can’t get something you don’t ask for. Be polite, and be honest. And (most importantly) – wait a day before sending that angry (edited!!!) email.

<strong>5. Is there anything you wished you had known as a student or young professional that you know now? Any advice that you'd like to share with younger female musicians?</strong>

When I was in college I used to think “I can’t wait until I am good enough that I don’t have to practice anymore.” I’m not sure where I got that idea, but I wish I knew sooner practicing wasn’t going to end, and that’s okay!

My advice for you younger female musicians:
<ol>
	<li>Work really hard and get your craft to the highest level you can.</li>
	<li>If you receive criticism, be open and consider its merits.</li>
	<li>Find a balance between being humble and being confident – check in with yourself from time to time and see if you’re in equilibrium.</li>
</ol>
<strong>6. Any resources you recommend? Books, podcasts, recordings that changed your life etc.</strong>

I think one of the biggest things that has changed my life is bullet journaling – It has helped me become far more organized than I was even with a planner (now I use both!). You can check out information about it here: <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">http://bulletjournal.com/</a>. I just use a moleskine notebook. It’s great for planning both short-term and long-term goals, which I would miss out from a regular day planner. Plus it is awesome always having a notebook with me for random thoughts, shopping lists, etc (with an index page to refer back to later!). I highly recommend it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Today's post is by our very own Co - Head Brass Chick -  <a href="http://www.kateamrine.com">Kate Amrine</a>. </em>

<img class="  wp-image-2592 alignleft" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_9698-for-email.jpg" alt="IMG_9698 for email.jpg" width="286" height="191" />

<strong>A passionate and creative performer, Kate Amrine is a prominent trumpet player balancing a multifaceted career from developing new repertoire and curating concerts to freelancing with many different groups in the New York City area.

<em>--- here are the Five Ways to Diversify Your Recital Repertoire ---</em>

<hr />
<p class="m_3277450187610039812p1"><span class="m_3277450187610039812s1">1. <strong>Don't limit yourself to standard instrumentation</strong> like brass + piano or brass quintet. Look into chamber music that involve brass with winds, strings, or percussion. Some of my favorites are Eric Ewazen's Trio for trumpet, violin, and piano; Handel's Let the Bright Seraphim for trumpet and soprano; and Libby Larsen's "Ridgerunner" for trumpet and percussion. <span class="m_3277450187610039812Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="m_3277450187610039812p1"><span class="m_3277450187610039812s1">2. <strong>Consider programming music by composers who are not dead white men.</strong> It can be such a great experience to work with a living composer who you know personally and can be a part of the process. Having an audience meet and hear from the composer also gives a whole new level to a performance. Use your recital as an opportunity to incorporate music by women composers and/or diverse groups who are often less represented and explored. <span class="m_3277450187610039812Apple-converted-space"> These efforts can have an incredible wave of reactions in audience members who may not have heard music by someone who looked like them and may not have realized those people even existed. </span></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p class="m_3277450187610039812p1"><span class="m_3277450187610039812s1">3. <strong>Make choices with lighting and staging</strong> that go beyond a standard classical recital. Sometimes it can be boring for an audience member to watch a performer stand in the same place behind the music stand for a while. Consider changing it up visually. Collaborate with a dancer or a lighting technician on a piece. Think of how you can incorporate something visually that adds a different element beyond what simply playing the piece would have conveyed. Personally, I have performed a solo in a balcony overlooking the recital hall, performed a piece entirely in the dark, and performed a piece with the performers spaced out around the venue instead of front and center on stage. </span></p>
&nbsp;

4. <strong>Perform some of your own compositions or arrangements. </strong>Outside of being a valuable skill and learning experience, it really adds something extra when an audience hears something written or arranged by the performer themselves. You are able to tell the story of the piece, your inspiration behind it, and why you chose to write it. These stories can connect you with your audience in a way that may often be more meaningful then playing xxx's Sonata Op. 99.

&nbsp;

5. <strong>Have the entire recital take place in a non traditional venue or format. </strong>Consider a venue outside the concert hall, like a bar or community center - where you may be able to attract a wider audience and create a different experience. Perhaps you can have a beer pairing with half of the pieces or create certain mini food courses with a movement of a piece. Even changing up the format and allowing audience members to walk around or chat in between pieces can create a different vibe that may be more refreshing than the standard classical concert experience.

---

There are many more options that I could have drawn from but hopefully these are helpful to opening up your perspective on recital repertoire. Many of them apply to standard concerts as well. We would love to hear which of these, or other options, you often take advantage of when planning a performance so please don't hesitate to comment or be in touch. Hope this helps!]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">If you’re wanting to bring more joy and PLAY back into your playing, it is my sincere hope that by reading about some of my journey, you may be inspired further on your own.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Take a Break.</strong> Much of my early progress came with my dedication to play everyday, even if it was just a little bit or very late at night (Sorry mom!). Although taking breaks can be controversial, it has become very valuable to me to check in regularly with my body and heart: How am I doing right now? Body, how are you? Heart, can I help you in any way? In listening and caring for these parts of myself, I am suddenly more available to bring my full presence back to the practice room or stage. Sometimes, what I needed was one guilt-free day off to go frolic in the woods, or sleep, or do some “meaningless” activities. These things can be so refreshing and rejuvenating to me! After a break, I often find that my playing is fresher, lighter, and simply more pleasant for everyone. I try to remind myself to be gentle. Treating myself well ultimately helps my playing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Nature.</strong> It can be refreshing to practice outside. Even when I lived in Manhattan, I went ahead and marched down the hill outside to go play some sonatas in Central Park. There have been many studies about the healing effects of spending time in nature. Playing with a flower right in front of me or making up a little ditty to play for one of my favorite trees can be so enjoyable, and help remind me of how connected we all are. When I’m in a beautiful and calm environment, my playing becomes more beautiful and calm as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Be ridiculous.</strong> Playfulness is a natural part of being human. Sometimes, in my adulthood, I can forget how to be playful. One of the fastest ways to break out of my shell, is to do something utterly ridiculous. I went to an open mic once and ended up doing the whole performance upside down, leaning backwards over a large wood block. It was terribly uncomfortable, and definitely hard to play, but it brought such a sense of lightness and playfulness to the performance that I still smile when I think about it today. As I look for opportunities to do something out-of-the-box, I find that my approach is infused with more curiosity and lightness. Note: please be careful if you decide to play upside down!</p>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Priorities.</strong> It can be easy, after playing for so long, to lose touch with why I started. What were my favorite things about playing when I was young? What was it about trumpet that I loved? Connecting back to my child-self, I remember the simple joy of playing, the wonder of the music. Bringing it back to the present, I ask myself: What are the most important things to me in life right now? How are these things supported by, or expressed through, music? When music and the rest of my life feel connected, my values and priorities can be expressed more easily. The music itself can feel more fulfilling and enjoyable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>No Wrong Notes.</strong> I know as a classical performer, this can be a stretch. “What do you mean, no wrong notes? Tell that to the conductor, thank you very much.” Probably the most healing part of my own journey back to a joyful relationship with music, was allowing myself to improvise. I took a couple months off of my regular practice routine and started playing by ear. I explored how the notes don’t really go “up” and “down” like the images on the page, but exist more or less in the same place - right at the tip of my lips. I started wondering where the music really comes from (feel free to write me about that one!). I found that I perceive the music first through feel, then visually, and lastly orally. I redefined what it was to make a “mistake,” seeing those moments as opportunities to get outside of my normal ruts and discover new sounds. All of this helped me understand myself better as a musician and ultimately find a way of playing that works for me. Through improvising, I was able to shift my view of music. I found myself dropping back into my heart, where that childlike wonder still lived, and enjoying the present-moment adventure of simply being alive.</p>

<b>Horn player Kelsey Ross is an active performer and educator currently based in New York City. Prior to moving to NYC, Kelsey earned both her M.M. and B.M. degrees from the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, as a student of Denise Tryon (former fourth horn, Philadelphia Orchestra). While in Baltimore, she recorded the music of Kevin Puts and Aaron Jay Kernis under the direction of Marin Alsop and has recorded pieces by emerging composers with the Peabody Wind Ensemble for Naxos Records. She was also a founding member of both the Brassanova Brass Quintet and Harbor City Wind Quintet which performed at venues throughout the Baltimore area.
</b>

<b>Recently, Kelsey made her Carnegie Hall debut performing with the New York String Orchestra under conductor Jaime Laredo. Kelsey has also participated in the Domaine Forget summer festival in Quebec and the Barry Tuckwell Institute in Colorado. She has played in master classes with David Cooper, Radovan Vlatkovic, Frøydis Ree Wekre, Gail Williams, Barry Tuckwell, Abel Pereira, and the American Horn Quartet.</b>

<strong>1. Have clear, specific goals</strong>

I’ve found that the best way to keep myself productive is to be as specific as possible with my goals. When I first got to school, there were so many different parts of my playing that I wanted to work on, and I did not know where to begin. Thankfully, my teacher helped me define goals to work towards so that I was focusing on just a few things at a time. For some people, these goals could be anything from cleaning up articulations to strengthening loud playing in the high range. For many people, the goal is as simple as winning an audition. Whatever your goal is, write it down.

<b>2. Create a plan - and stick to it</b>

Now that you have your goals in mind, it’s time to create a plan of action to reach them. If your goal is to win an audition, what do you need to do to get to that point? Figure out how much time each day you will dedicate to your audition excerpts, how far in advance you will start working on the excerpts, at what point you will start playing mock auditions, and how many you will play each day/week. Schedule out each step leading up to your goal and again, write out your plan so that every time you start a practice session you know exactly what to work on. No more aimless practicing.

<b>3. Find a friend to keep you accountable.</b>
Sometimes it can be hard to keep up the motivation, which is why I like to partner with a friend to keep me accountable in sticking with my plan. While I was in school, my friends and I would keep each other motivated to wake up early and practice before most of our peers were even awake. Knowing that my friends were also waking up and getting work done motivated me to do the same. Surround yourself with positive, hard-working people who inspire you, and you’ll be motivated to be as productive as they are!

<b>4. Eliminate distractions</b>

The more focused you are, the more productive your practice session will be. If possible, find a quiet place to practice and put your phone on airplane mode so you’re not tempted to check your notifications. If you can’t resist your phone, put it outside of your room and use a separate tuner/metronome to practice. Figure out what time of day you are the most focused. For me, this is early in the morning and late afternoon. Therefore, I try to schedule most of my practicing during those times to maximize my focused energy.

<b>5. Record yourself  </b>

It can be difficult to evaluate the larger picture of your own playing, especially when you are focusing on specific details of your technique. Recording is a great way to hear your playing from someone else’s perspective. When you record yourself and listen back, you can notice things that you might not hear while you are playing your instrument. I’ve found that recording myself every day has made my practice sessions more efficient because it helps me pinpoint exactly what I need to work on, which allows me to set specific goals for my practice sessions.

P.S. Every so often, take a step back and notice your improvements. Remember to celebrate the small wins!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week's Five Things Friday post comes to us from <a href="http://www.kateumble.com/">Dr. Kate Umble Smucker</a>, who you may remember from her post, <a href="https://www.brasschicks.com/2017/10/27/five-yoga-poses-to-release-neck-and-shoulder-tension/">Five Yoga Poses to Release Neck and Shoulder Tension,</a> on Brass Chicks last October. This week, she has produced a great video of a five-minute evening yoga flow!

<em><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2083" src="https://www.brasschicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0345-2.jpg?w=200" alt="IMG_0345-2" width="212" height="318" />Dr. Kate Umble Smucker is a trumpet player and music educator based in New York City. She currently plays with <a href="http://www.calliopebrass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calliope Brass</a> Quintet and teaches trumpet at the <a href="http://www.musicconservatory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Music Conservatory of Westchester</a>. Kate is also a 200 hour registered yoga teacher. She is passionate about sharing her knowledge of yoga with fellow musicians so they too can experience the benefits she has enjoyed by incorporating yoga practice with trumpet practice. </em>

<em>Kate is a dreamer who loves to bring big ideas to life. Working with Calliope Brass, Kate assisted in the development of the educational show, “What’s Your Story?” She is a founding member of <a href="http://www.sparkbrass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spark Brass, </a>a brass and percussion ensemble dedicated to promoting the positive impact of music education. She is also the founding artistic director of Lancaster New Sounds, a concert series that showcases new music by living composers. Her love of jazz prompted her to put together and lead the 18-piece King Street Big Band which is still active in Lancaster, PA.</em>

<em>Kate holds a Doctorate in Trumpet Performance from the University of Missouri in Kansas City, a Masters of Music from the University of North Texas, and a Bachelor of Music Education (K-12 instrumental) and a Bachelor in Trumpet Performance from the University of Northern Colorado. Her primary teachers were Dr. Keith Benjamin, Professor Keith Johnson and Dr. Robert Murray.</em>

Hello Brass Chicks!

For this Five Things Friday, as your brass musician/yogi in residence, I decided to create a five minute flow you can use to unwind at the end of a long day. Think of it as a way to give your body a hug and say, “Good job body! You’re amazing! Keep up the good work!”

I really enjoyed making this video and I hope you find it helpful. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any requests for poses to release or strengthen certain areas. I am also available to travel to you for a private customized yoga session, or to work with you and a few friends. You can get in touch via email: <a href="mailto:kateumble@gmail.com">kateumble@gmail.com</a>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAgDsY12dk

Namaste 🙏
Kate Umble Smucker]]></content:encoded>
